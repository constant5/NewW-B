<p>The mega-rich family behind the OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma is back to selling its highly addictive pain-killer with underhanded tactics and deceptive advertisingâ€”this time in China, via its international company, Mundipharma. Thatâ€™s all according to a searing <a href="https://apnews.com/3ff1dfa05dac46ebb2615f729d947c0f">new investigation by the Associated Press</a>.</p>
<p>The Sackler family, which owns both Purdue and Mundipharma, is embroiled in litigation in the United States over its alleged role in sparking the countryâ€™s epidemic of opioid abuse and overdoses. Thousands of plaintiffsâ€”many state and local governmentsâ€”claim that Purdue and the Sacklers misled patients, doctors, and regulators on the addictiveness of their drugs, aggressively marketed them, and wooed doctors into over-prescribing them.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/09/purdue-files-for-bankruptcy-as-states-claim-sacklers-are-hiding-money/">Purdue has since declared bankruptcy</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/02/purdue-will-stop-forcefully-pushing-oxycontin-focus-on-constipation-instead/">stopped promoting OxyContin in the US</a>, the Sacklers seem to be employing the same practices in China.</p>
<p>Based on documents and interviews with multiple Mundipharma representatives in China, the AP investigation found that reps were at times posing as doctors, providing debunked information that its long-acting opioids are safe and less addictive, and even illegally copying private medical records of patients to inform sales tactics.</p>
<p>When an AP reporter informed one of the Mundipharma reps that some of the marketing information was incorrect, she replied: â€œIâ€™m shocked... Why after more than 10 years would they still do the same thing and go against the laws and regulations of society?â€</p>
<p>In a response to the AP, Mundipharma said it promotes ethical behavior and legal compliance. It added: â€œWe have detailed policies covering interactions with healthcare professionals, grants and donations, and sponsorships and incentives.â€</p>
<p>The AP reported that Chinaâ€™s National Health Commission, National Medical Products Administration, State Administration for Market Regulation, and National Development and Reform Commission declined to comment. The Sackler family representatives did not respond to a request for comments.</p>
<p>Mundipharma, meanwhile, is still hiring in China.</p>
