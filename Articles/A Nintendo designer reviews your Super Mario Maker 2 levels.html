<p>There are over 7 million courses available in <em>Super Mario Maker 2</em>. And at least seven of them are pretty fun.</p>
<p>Seriously, though, making a good Mario level is one of those tasks that's harder than it looks. So what differentiates a satisfying level from a frustrating one?</p>
<p>To find out, we reached out to both the <em>Mario Maker</em> and Nintendo Switch subreddits and asked readers to submit their favorite homemade levels for review. After sifting through pages and pages of submissions, we picked out a handful of interesting examples for a fuller evaluation by Corey Olcsvary of <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Nintendo_Treehouse">Nintendo's storied Treehouse product development division</a>.</p>
<p>In the above video, Olcsvary plays through the levels and gives his real-time assessments of what they did well or badly. It's a good sign, for example, when he says things like "when I've been failing I feel like it's my fault." A strong theme can make a level stand out—as with one example here that looks like the inside of a computer. Another course offers players a "sneak preview of... impending doom" via a quick trip through a clear pipe, a touch Olcsvary appreciated. Then there's the largely enemy-free, theme-park-inspired level that proves "you don't need to make a course difficult to make it fun."</p>
<p>Olcsvary also took us behind the scenes a bit, showing how the designers at Nintendo Treehouse used playtesting and feedback to refine a level that ended up <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwQh6oYH7mk">used in this year's Nintendo's World Championships</a>. That led to what might be his most important piece of advice: "Get someone to playtest [your level]. You might change it up based on their feedback."</p>
<p>Here are the course IDs for the levels shown in this video, if you want to try them out on your own copy of <em>Super Mario Maker 2</em>:</p>
