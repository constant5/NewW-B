<p>Each month, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) puts out <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/briefings/20191121.pdf">an analysis</a> of the previous monthâ€™s weather after the final tally. The most recent update covers an odd October <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/201910">for the US</a>, where the month included some terrifying wildfire conditions in California. This latest analysis also provides the long-range outlook for the winter months.</p>
<p>October provides another good reminder to Americans that their country is not the entire planet. Courtesy of the jet stream doing its thing, the western US experienced notably cool temperatures for much of the month. A dozen states had Octobers that ranked somewhere around the 8<sup>thÂ </sup>coldest on record. Despite warmer temperatures along the East Coast, it was ranked as the 21<sup>st</sup> coldest for the nation.</p>

<p>Looking <em><a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/201910">globally</a></em>, however, the western US was an outlier. Overall, it was the 2<sup>nd</sup> warmest October on record, behind only 2015. And with most of 2019 behind us, the final number for the year is crystallizing. NOAA puts the odds of 2019 being among the five warmest years on record at more than 99.9%. (So theyâ€™re saying thereâ€™s a chance.) More specifically, thereâ€™s now about an 85% probability of coming in second behind 2016â€”exactly the prediction we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/02/2018-ranks-as-fourth-warmest-year-for-globe/">shared in early February</a>.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center large"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/noaa_201910_world.png"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/noaa_201910_world-640x495.png" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/noaa_201910_world.png 2x"></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/noaa_201910_world.png"class="caption-link" rel="nofollow"></a> (credit: <a rel="nofollow" class="caption-link" href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/201910">NOAA</a>)</p></div>
<p>Of course, October also saw a number of fires in California, and the state was in near-constant warnings of dangerous fire conditions, which were accompanied by massive (imposed) power outages and evacuations. We saw a repeat of the ugly combination of weather that led to deadly fires in recent yearsâ€”a late arrival of the rainy season and strong Santa Ana and Diablo wind events.</p>

<p>Many areas hit record measures for vegetation dryness, including the nearly 78,000 acres that burned in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kincade_Fire">Kincade Fire</a> north of the Bay Area. And as high air pressure formed over the interior of the West, the ingredients were there for fast, dry, warm winds racing downslope over California mountains and toward the sea, stoking wildfires like bellows.</p>
<p>California wasnâ€™t the only place feeling dry, as drought conditions extended across the Southwest, and only enough rain fell to barely help with drought in southern Texas. But again, the eastern half of the country was very different, with a great deal of precipitation lifting last month to the 8<sup>th</sup> wettest October on record for the nation as a whole.</p>

<h2>ENSO on the fence-o</h2>
<p>The remainder of NOAAâ€™s update relates to whatâ€™s going on in the Pacific Ocean. There, a constant oscillation between El NiÃ±o and La NiÃ±a conditionsâ€”an eastward sloshing of warm water versus a westward blowing of colder deep water, respectivelyâ€”has implications for weather patterns around the world. Because this â€œ<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o%E2%80%93Southern_Oscillation">El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation,</a>â€ or ENSO, changes slowly, it can be forecast out about six months.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s the basis for NOAAâ€™s seasonal outlooks. These arenâ€™t forecasts in the sense of the five-day predictions you rely on every day but instead show where the odds are tilted in favor of wetter-than-average or warmer-than-average conditions overall. That doesnâ€™t mean there wonâ€™t be varying weather events, but it gives you an idea of the big-picture patterns.</p>
<p>Neutral conditions in between El NiÃ±o and La NiÃ±a are expected to continue for the next few months. Combining that knowledge with the other patterns of ocean surface temperatures currently in place, NOAAâ€™s winter outlook for December, January, and February shows how things are shaping up across the US.</p>

<p>Much of the country is leaning toward warmer winter weather. But particularly as the season progresses, the Great Lakes region looks like it will shift from average temperatures to leaning cooler. As for precipitation, itâ€™s more likely to be a drier-than-average winter in much of California and parts of the Gulf Coast, with the odds favoring wetter weather across the northern half of the country as well as Alaska.</p>
<p>That means the drought outlook carries little good news for California and Texas, but this analysis is somewhat hopeful for the Arizona/Colorado region and dry patches in the Southeast.</p>
