<p>When Tesla <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/11/tesla-wants-to-reinvent-the-pickup-with-the-39900-cybertruck/">unveiled its new pickup truck</a> last Wednesday, many critics blasted it as ugly and impractical. But despite these criticisms, more than 200,000 people have put down a $100 deposit to reserve a spot in line for the new vehicle, Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198788116372344832">announced</a> on Sunday.</p>
<p>All-electric designs have helped every Tesla vehicle stand out from its competition, but Tesla's Cybertruck is unconventional even by Tesla's standards. Other pickup trucks are boxy, with a square cabin in the front and a flatbed in the back. The Cybertruck has a triangular design that looks a bit like the DeLorean in <em>Back to the Future</em>.</p>

<p>The new pickup is expected to begin production in about two years. Tesla says it will start at $39,900 for a model with 250 miles of range. A high-end model with 500 miles of range, three motors, and a 0-60 time of 2.9 seconds will cost $69,900.</p>
<p>The signup rate for Cybertruck pre-orders—200,000 orders in four days—isn't quite as impressive as for the Model 3 in 2016. Tesla had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/31/tesla-sold-115k-model-3-preorders-before-anyone-even-saw-the-car/">received 150,000 pre-orders</a> for the Model 3 within hours of the unveiling event and had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/04/with-300m-and-counting-in-model-s-pre-orders-how-can-tesla-handle-that-cash/">275,000 orders</a> in hand a few days later.</p>
<p>Moreover, that comparison comes with a huge caveat: reserving a Model 3 required a $1,000 deposit, helping to ensure that only serious customers would put down a deposit. By contrast, Tesla is only asking Cybertruck purchasers to put down $100—a much lower level of commitment. So customer interest in the Cybertruck, while impressive, does not seem to be at Model 3 levels.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Tesla took the opposite tack when the company unveiled its Model Y SUV earlier this year: it asked for pre-order deposits of $2,500. That may be a good way to gauge which customers are serious about buying a vehicle, but it isn't a good way to generate impressive sign-up numbers. As far as I can tell, Tesla hasn't released any statistics on Model Y pre-orders.</p>
