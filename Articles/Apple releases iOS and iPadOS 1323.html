<p>It has only been 11 days since Apple released iOS 13.2.2, but once again we're seeing evidence of a greatly increased update cadence. Today sees the release of iOS and iPadOS 13.2.3.</p>
<p>This latest release is mostly a bug fix updateâ€”of course, that was apparent from the version number. Traditionally, Apple numbers its updates to signify their importance. Top-level updates like iOS 12 or iOS 13 are annualized major releases that start a new update cycle. One decimal point down (like iOS 13.2) denotes an update that adds major new features. One further point down (like this one, iOS 13.2.1) usually indicates that it is a bug fix update.</p>
<p>The update this week fixes problems users have encountered with search in the Mail, Files, and Notes apps. It also addresses a bug with attachments in Messages, an issue that stopped apps from downloading properly, and another with Exchange accounts under Mail that has frustrated many users.</p>
<p>Here are Apple's update notes for both iOS 13.2.3 and iPadOS 13.2.3:</p>
<blockquote><p>iOS 13.2.3 includes bug fixes and improvements for your iPhone. This update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixes an issue where system search and search within Mail, Files, and Notes might not work</li>
<li>Addresses an issue where photos, links, and other attachments might not display in the Messages details view</li>
<li>Fixes an issue that could prevent apps from downloading content in the background</li>
<li>Resolves issues that may prevent Mail from fetching new messages, and fail to include and quote original message content in Exchange accounts</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The update should roll out to all devices supported by iOS or iPadOS 13 today. Users can check for it in their devices' Settings apps.</p>
<p>Apple is also working on a major feature release, iOS and iPadOS 13.3. That update is currently in beta with developers. Its biggest feature at present is the ability to set messaging and communication limits in Screen Time. It also allows users to disable the appearance of Animoji and Memoji stickers in the system's emoji keyboard.</p>
