<p>In an interview for the Axios HBO show, <a href="https://www.axios.com/uber-ceo-saudi-arabia-jamal-khashoggi-mistake-92865f2a-d97c-4d6a-b171-5e7c0a69e77a.html">released Monday morning</a>, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi seemed to downplay last year's death of <em>Washington Post</em> columnist Jamal Khashoggi. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">CIA concluded</a> that Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered Khashoggi's assassination.</p>
<p>"It's a serious mistake," Khosrowshahi said. "We've made mistakes too, right, with self-driving, and we stopped driving and we're recovering from that mistake. I think that people make mistakes, it doesn't mean that they can never be forgiven. I think they've taken it seriously."</p>

<p>Within hours—and before Axios published the comments—Khosrowshahi walked them back.</p>
<p>"I said something in the moment that I do not believe," he said in a statement to Axios. "When it comes to Jamal Khashoggi, his murder was reprehensible and should not be forgotten or excused."</p>
<p>Axios's Dan Primack asked Khosrowshahi about the issue because Saudi Arabia's government is one of Uber's biggest shareholders. Yasir Al-Rumayyan, an official from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, sits on Uber's board.</p>
<p>When Axios asked if Al-Rumayyan should seek re-election to Uber's board, Khosrowshahi responded that he "has been a very constructive board member. I personally have valued his input greatly."</p>
<p>When Primack pointed out the CIA's findings—that far from being a mere "mistake," Salman had ordered Khashoggi's murder—Khosrowshahi said that he "didn't read that part of the CIA report."</p>
<p>"They're just like any other shareholder," Khosrowshahi said. "Now we're a public company. Anyone can invest in our company if they choose to do so."</p>
<p>An hour later, Khosrowshahi "called Axios to express regret for the language he used."</p>
