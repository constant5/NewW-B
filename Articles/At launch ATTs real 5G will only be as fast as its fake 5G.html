<p>AT&amp;T will soon offer 5G mobile service on its 850MHz spectrum, which will enable wider coverage than existing 5G networks but offer only 4G-like speeds at launch. Significant speed increases will arrive in 2020, AT&amp;T says.</p>
<p>The 5G networks already deployed by carriers use millimeter-wave signals that don't travel far and are easily blocked by walls and other obstacles. This has resulted in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/11/verizons-new-5g-coverage-maps-show-just-how-sparse-the-network-is/">coverage maps</a> with small pockets of 5G, and 4G just about everywhere else.</p>
<p>But 5G can work on all frequencies, such as the lower-band frequencies used by 4G. There isn't as much spectrum available on these bands, so you won't see anything like the huge speed increases available on millimeter-wave spectrum. But 5G on low-band spectrum will cover wider areas and indoor spaces and hopefully bring some speed increasesâ€”Verizon says 5G on the lower bands will be like "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/08/verizon-5g-speeds-on-low-spectrum-bands-will-be-more-like-good-4g/">good 4G</a>."</p>
<p>AT&amp;T'sÂ <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/att-extends-5g-leadership-across-the-us-300963570.html">announcement today</a> listed the first cities slated to get 5G on low-band spectrum:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the coming weeks, our 5G network will launch over low-band spectrum in the Indianapolis; Pittsburgh; Providence, Rhode Island; Rochester, New York; and San Diego market areas. We also plan to launch in several more markets, including Boston; Las Vegas; Milwaukee; New York City; San Francisco; Birmingham, Alabama; Bridgeport, Connecticut; Buffalo, New York; Louisville, Kentucky; San Jose, California; and others.</p></blockquote>
<p>AT&amp;T also published a PDF with <a href="https://about.att.com/content/dam/snrdocs/ATT_5G_MAPS.pdf">maps of expected 5G coverage</a>, but the maps are of coverage projected for February 2020 rather than what will be available at launch.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T previously offered <a href="https://www.business.att.com/learn/5G.html?bref=IB5gAT5GC005GB00L">millimeter-wave 5G to business customers</a>Â but not to regular consumers. AT&amp;T told us that 5G on millimeter waves will be offered to consumers "at a later date." Initially, regular consumers will only have access to 5G on low-band spectrum.</p>

<h2>Speeds similar to LTE-Advanced, aka â€œ5G Eâ€</h2>
<p>AT&amp;T's announcement doesn't say which spectrum band it is using, but an AT&amp;T spokesperson told Ars that "at launch we're dedicating a portion of our 850Mhz spectrum to 5G connectivity." AT&amp;T is also <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/mobile/5g/in-nationwide-5g-it-will-be-atandts-700mhz-vs-t-mobiles-600mhz/a/d-id/751774">expected</a> to eventually launch 5G on its 700MHz spectrum in order to deploy the next-generation cellular technology across the US.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T's announcement didn't reveal the exact speeds customers can expect, but the spokesperson told us that "data speeds on AT&amp;T's 5G network are initially expected to be comparable to LTE-Advanced speeds at the time of launch." LTE-Advanced, a form of 4G, is the proper name for what AT&amp;T has misleadingly called "5G E." In March, OpenSignal <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/03/atts-5g-e-is-actually-slower-than-verizon-and-t-mobile-4g-study-finds/">said its research</a> found that AT&amp;T's "5G E" phones got average speeds of 28.8Mbps.</p>
<p>Low-band 5G should provide better speeds than LTE-Advanced later on, though, as AT&amp;T told us that speeds will "rapidly evolv[e]" from the 4G-like baseline expected at launch. The speed upgrades will come when AT&amp;T enables more 5G capabilities on low-band spectrum. That includes <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/at-t-expects-2020-start-major-5g-handset-upgrade-cycle-exec-says">dynamic spectrum sharing</a>, which AT&amp;T says it will deploy in 2020.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T also said it will offer 5G nationwide in the first half of 2020. AT&amp;T said its 5G on millimeter-wave spectrum is available to businesses today in 21 cities and will reach parts of 30 cities by early 2020.</p>
<p>Referring to the LTE-Advanced form of 4G as "5G E" isn't the only confusing 5G marketing in AT&amp;T's arsenal. While AT&amp;T calls 5G on low-frequency bands plain-old "5G," the company uses the term "5G+" for 5G on millimeter-wave spectrum.</p>
<p>Customers will need a compatible 5G device and a service plan that includes access to 5G. AT&amp;T's announcement said it will include 5G in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/atts-priciest-unlimited-plan-now-allows-100gb-of-un-throttled-data/">two new plans</a>, namely Unlimited Elite ($85 a month for a single line or $50 per line with four lines) and Unlimited Extra ($75 a month for a single line or $40 per line with four lines).</p>
<p>Those are the only plans with 5G access so far. "Consumers with a compatible device will need to be on one of our latest unlimited plansâ€”AT&amp;T Unlimited Extra or AT&amp;T Unlimited Eliteâ€”to access 5G over low-band or millimeter-wave spectrum," AT&amp;T told Ars.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T today also said that on November 25, it will start taking <a href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/samsung-galaxy-note10plus-5g-256gb-aura-glow.html">preorders</a> for the 5G-enabled Samsung Galaxy Note10+, AT&amp;T's first 5G phone for non-business consumers. AT&amp;T previously offered the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2019/samsung_galaxy_s10_5g.html">to business customers</a>.</p>
