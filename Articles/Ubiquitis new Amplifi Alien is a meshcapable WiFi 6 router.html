<p>Ubiquiti's consumer brand Amplifi has launched a new Wi-Fi 6 product line called "AmpliFi Alien." The original Amplifi products were typically sold as three-piece Wi-Fi mesh kits, so we got a little excited when we saw a price tag of $380 for <a href="https://amplifi.com/alien">Alien</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that price is for a single router, not a kit—which means that Amplifi Alien, like <a href="https://amzn.to/2QAETX2">Orbi AX6000</a>, is still in stratospheric "you probably don't want this yet" territory where price is concerned. We have a sneaking suspicion both these price points are a bit of a gouge, since TP-Link's Broadcom <a href="https://www.broadcom.com/products/wireless/wireless-lan-infrastructure/bcm6750">BCM6750</a>-based <a href="https://amzn.to/2XDbkpd">AX1500</a> Wi-Fi 6 router is already available for under $100.</p>
<p>Like Amplifi's earlier products, Alien features a small touchscreen on the router which can display the time, speed-test results, and offer some simple direct network control. Its power and WAN ports are recessed inside the base of the unit with a cable-management tunnel, but the four LAN ports are arranged along the back side of the barrel, opposite the touchscreen.</p>

          In this front/top shot of Alien, we can see the 274x1268 color touchscreen—and, of course, the glowing green ring at the bottom, which can be disabled if you don't like the look.                      [credit:

<p>Under the hood, Alien offers 5GHz 8x8 and 2.4GHz 4x4 radios, and—curiously—a Wi-Fi 5-only 5GHz 4x4 radio. Given the marketing copy, we expect that Alien will use the Wi-Fi 6 radio for backhaul in a multiple-router mesh setup. We think it's an odd choice to include a Wi-Fi 5-only radio instead of sticking with Wi-Fi 6 on all three bands, though.</p>
<p>Amplifi describes these radios as delivering 7685Mbps total capacity and Alien as covering "twice the square footage" of Amplifi's previous mesh Wi-Fi efforts, complete with a bar chart demonstrating the difference between 2 and 1. However, as we have exhaustively covered in the past, Wi-Fi marketing numbers are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/03/802-eleventy-what-a-deep-dive-into-why-wi-fi-kind-of-sucks/">useless</a>. We won't really have any idea of how good Alien is until we've gotten a unit or two to test.</p>
<p>Alien hasn't shown up on Amazon yet, but it's available directly at the Amplifi <a href="https://amplifi.com/alien">website</a>.</p>
