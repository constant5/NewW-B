<p>Brad McQuaid, the lead developer for the groundbreaking massively multiplayer online (MMO) game <em>EverQuest</em>, has died, according to an update from his development team. He was 51.</p>
<p>Details about the circumstances of his death have not been shared publicly, other than a mention that he passed away in his home. The Twitter account for <em>Pantheon</em>, McQuaid's project at the time of his death, and Visionary Realms, the company behind it, <a href="https://twitter.com/PantheonMMO/status/1196943965028802561">tweeted</a> out the following announcement:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is with deep regret we share that Brad McQuaid passed away last night. He will be deeply missed and forever remembered by gamers worldwide.</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing us together through your worlds. Rest in peace <a class="PrettyLink profile customisable h-card" href="https://twitter.com/Aradune"><span class="PrettyLink-prefix">@</span><span class="PrettyLink-value">Aradune</span></a>.</p>
<p>VR offers our deepest condolences to Brad’s family.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,13586/">McQuaid</a> worked as a game programmer and designer starting back in the late 1980s, but he is most well-known for his role as lead programmer, producer, and designer (at various times) on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/everquests-long-strange-20-year-trip-still-has-no-end-in-sight/"><em>EverQuest</em></a>, the 1999 massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that defined the genre to this day. <em>EQ</em>, which adapted the DikuMUD formula from text games for a 3D persistent graphical virtual world, was a breakthrough moment for MMORPGs. Its success codified that model for the genre as other, different ideas of what MMORPGs might look like (such as those posited by <em>Meridian 59</em>, <em>Underlight</em>, or <em>Ultima Online</em>) largely faded into memory.</p>
<p>McQuaid was involved in designing some of the very first raids as we know them today, and his work had significant influence on later games like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/world-of-warcraft/"><em>World of Warcraft</em></a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/final-fantasy/"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a>, <em>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/elder-scrolls/">Elder Scrolls</a> Online</em>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/destiny/"><em>Destiny</em></a>, and many more.</p>
<p>He later went on to co-found Sigil Games, which developed and launched the hardcore MMO <em>Vanguard: Saga of Heroes</em>. The game found a niche audience seeking demanding, group-oriented content—a focus of McQuaid's work over the years—amidst a market of increasingly casual and solo-friendly MMOs. Most recently, McQuaid was working at Visionary Realms on the above-mentioned <em>Pantheon</em>, which marries that model to some newer game-design ideas. <em>Pantheon</em> is still in development.</p>
<p>Visionary Realms communications chief BenD shared these notes <a href="https://www.pantheonmmo.com/content/forums/topic/11315/with-deepest-regrets-aradune-has-passed-away/view/post_id/219996">on the <em>Pantheon</em> forums</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Brad was a visionary, a mentor, an artist, a trailblazer, a friend, a husband, a father. He touched thousands of lives with his dreams and concepts. He changed the landscape of video games forever. He will be deeply missed and forever remembered in life and in Pantheon.</p>
<p>Thank you, Brad, for bringing us together through your worlds. Rest in peace, Aradune.</p>
<p>All of us at Visionary Realms offer our deepest condolences to Brad’s family and during this most difficult time, we kindly ask that you respect the privacy of Brad’s family.</p></blockquote>
